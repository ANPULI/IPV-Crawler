If you need a little additional assistance with keeping track of your kids and their technology use, mSpy is a robust app with additional monitoring options, which allow parents to see who their kids call, what they text, and their GPS location among other activities.

With over 1.000.000 users worldwide it continuously provides high both quality product and service. Mobile Spy (mSpy) is the world’s most popular cell phone for a reason: it accesses a massive amount of information from a targeted smartphone or tablet.

Teaching your children to use the internet is almost like teaching them to cycle. When I discussed this issue with the executives of parental control software mSpy, they were very clear about what kind of surveillance is okay and what is not. Informing your child that they are being monitored for their own safety and that it will stop once they have learned to use the internet well is okay. A recent experiment shows the potential dangers of Snapchat. In a recent social media experiment by video blogger Coby Persin, a 14-year-old girl named Sasha was lured into a face-to-face meeting with an adult man via the social media platform Snapchat. This video is a must-watch for parents whose children are active on social media. As an added layer of protection, it’s a good idea to invest in a third-party service such as mSpy parental control. These services allow parents to protect their children from online dangers, even when they can’t physically be around when they are online, in ways such as: Tracking apps such as FB messenger and Snapchat, Tracking their location, Reading their text messages, keeping track of their calls, etc. These services are invaluable to working mothers. mSpy is an app built around the idea that knowing is always better than hoping.

That’s why we’ve made sure mSpy works on your device, no matter what operating system you and your family use. And with both jailbreak and local sync solutions, it’s easy to get up and running. Android iOS Jailbreak Option Local Sync Option If Any Questions Left  A cell phone tracker, also known as a phone monitoring app, is an app designed to let you see what’s happening on someone else’s phone, all without having to physically look over their shoulder. The best remote cell phone tracking apps work in hidden mode, so they won’t even know you’re using it.   If you want to track a cell phone, you need to install special software on the device you want to monitor. Once installed, seeing what’s on their phone is as easy as logging in to your phone tracker account and browsing through your own personal dashboard.   We believe so. But don’t take our word for it. Ask the 1.5 million people who count on mSpy to give them the information they need to make smarter decisions for their family. Or judge for yourself. Our mobile monitoring app solution has all the features you need to keep tabs on them.   That depends on whether you’re using a jailbroken phone or choosing to use our solution out of the box with active sync. In some cases, data from their phone takes a few minutes to reach your control panel. But for the most part, everything happens in real time.   Absolutely. When you use a mobile tracker that works in hidden mode, the person you’re tracking won’t know that you’re using software to find out what they’re doing online. So if you’re looking for an app to track phone without them knowing, mSpy is the real deal.   You can use the mSpy phone tracking app to keep tabs on your children if they’re considered minors. What’s more, you can use mobile tracking software to track others as long as you have their explicit consent to do so. If not, you should think twice about using phone monitoring software. And no matter what, consider checking your local laws before using mSpy.   That depends which mobile phone tracking app for iOS or Android you choose. Some apps can’t be hidden, so the person you’re monitoring might be able to detect that you’re keeping tabs on them. mSpy, however, works in hidden mode, so they won’t know that you’re using it.   Great question. We’re often asked what makes the best phone tracking app, and while everyone’s needs are different, we keep coming back to the same three answers. Features. Features. Features. Mobile phone tracking apps come in all shapes and sizes, but only a handful are loaded with every feature you need. mSpy is one of them. We’ve made sure it works with the latest social media apps. And we’ve armed it with features that make it work with apps that aren’t even out yet.   No. If you want to be able to see what’s on their phone, you need to install some sort of cell phone monitoring app on their device. Depending on which kind of device you’re using and whether or not it’s jailbroken or rooted, the installation process varies.   There are some free mobile phone tracking solutions, but they aren’t very good. For the most part, these solutions are very limited in features, offering you the option to show you someone’s location on a map. And in many cases, companies that claim to offer the best phone tracking app for free are just there to scam you out of money.   No. Knowing just the IMEI number won’t get you very far in terms of using a cell phone monitoring app. If a mobile phone tracking solution claims to be able to help you track someone by phone number or IMEI number, steer clear. There’s a good chance that you’re being taken for a ride.

That’s why we’ve made sure mSpy works on your device, no matter what operating system you and your family use. And with both jailbreak and local sync solutions, it’s easy to get up and running. Android iOS Jailbreak Option Local Sync Option If Any Questions Left  A cell phone tracker, also known as a phone monitoring app, is an app designed to let you see what’s happening on someone else’s phone, all without having to physically look over their shoulder. The best remote cell phone tracking apps work in hidden mode, so they won’t even know you’re using it.   If you want to track a cell phone, you need to install special software on the device you want to monitor. Once installed, seeing what’s on their phone is as easy as logging in to your phone tracker account and browsing through your own personal dashboard.   We believe so. But don’t take our word for it. Ask the 1.5 million people who count on mSpy to give them the information they need to make smarter decisions for their family. Or judge for yourself. Our mobile monitoring app solution has all the features you need to keep tabs on them.   That depends on whether you’re using a jailbroken phone or choosing to use our solution out of the box with active sync. In some cases, data from their phone takes a few minutes to reach your control panel. But for the most part, everything happens in real time.   Absolutely. When you use a mobile tracker that works in hidden mode, the person you’re tracking won’t know that you’re using software to find out what they’re doing online. So if you’re looking for an app to track phone without them knowing, mSpy is the real deal.   You can use the mSpy phone tracking app to keep tabs on your children if they’re considered minors. What’s more, you can use mobile tracking software to track others as long as you have their explicit consent to do so. If not, you should think twice about using phone monitoring software. And no matter what, consider checking your local laws before using mSpy.   That depends which mobile phone tracking app for iOS or Android you choose. Some apps can’t be hidden, so the person you’re monitoring might be able to detect that you’re keeping tabs on them. mSpy, however, works in hidden mode, so they won’t know that you’re using it.   Great question. We’re often asked what makes the best phone tracking app, and while everyone’s needs are different, we keep coming back to the same three answers. Features. Features. Features. Mobile phone tracking apps come in all shapes and sizes, but only a handful are loaded with every feature you need. mSpy is one of them. We’ve made sure it works with the latest social media apps. And we’ve armed it with features that make it work with apps that aren’t even out yet.   No. If you want to be able to see what’s on their phone, you need to install some sort of cell phone monitoring app on their device. Depending on which kind of device you’re using and whether or not it’s jailbroken or rooted, the installation process varies.   There are some free mobile phone tracking solutions, but they aren’t very good. For the most part, these solutions are very limited in features, offering you the option to show you someone’s location on a map. And in many cases, companies that claim to offer the best phone tracking app for free are just there to scam you out of money.   No. Knowing just the IMEI number won’t get you very far in terms of using a cell phone monitoring app. If a mobile phone tracking solution claims to be able to help you track someone by phone number or IMEI number, steer clear. There’s a good chance that you’re being taken for a ride.

You might really wanna consider contacting him today. He’s definitely going to be of great help. The thought that your spouse could be cheating on you is devastating. Nothing under the sun is more panic than a cheating spouse. It’s one of the major reasons behind the number of domestic issues in society. It’s really very terrible for anyone to bear a cheating partner. The best way to handle these suspicions is to do everything in your power to catch them, preferably in the act. While open, honest dialogue is always the best course of action, it doesn't always yield open, and honest results when you’re dealing with a deceitful partner. And despite the increasingly flexible definitions of relationships, significant others continue to step out on their relationships and their partners. Perhaps, you’re that suspecting partner. You've felt it. That sick, nagging feeling in the pit of your stomach, you are absolutely certain your partner is cheating on you. You’ve recognized the signs. Now you want proof.

These commissions are how we maintain our free service for consumers. Compensation, along with hours of in-depth research, determines where & how companies appear on our site. Pros Cons Bottomline Parents can benefit from MSPY, which is one of the best cell phone tracking apps on the market. It comes in different plans with various levels of support and lets you customize the features and services that you want. MSPY provides logs of chats, calls, photos, apps used and websites visited. There is only so much that you can do as a parent to keep your child safe. Kids today face more dangers than most parents think about both at home and school. The days of bullies picking on your kids and calling them names in the hallways are no more. Bullies today often use the web and social media apps to threaten and harass others. While you might feel helpless and wonder if there is anything that you can do, using MSPY can help you feel better. This is a monitoring tool that is easy for parents to use and allows them to keep an eye on their kids when they can’t be nearby. Nearly 90% of teenagers today use at least one type of social media site or app every day. That combined with the more than 35% of kids who use smartphone messaging apps shows you that kids today are online more than ever before. They can come across dangerous people as well as common scams and have problems learning how to say no. with MSPY, you can see what your kids do and help them avoid the scams and dangerous people they come across daily. No matter how old your kids are, you’ll find MSPY and our MSPY review helpful. Many parents today grew up during the beginning days of the internet. They remember hearing warnings from their parents and teachers about sharing photos on the web or handing out their phone numbers and addresses. Thanks to Facebook and similar sites, kids now share more information online than they ever did before. Predators can track their schedules and not only see when they have soccer practice or hang out with their friends, but also when they’re away from their parents and when no adults are around. More than half of all teens admit to having online conversations with strangers, and another 75% of teens claimed that they received explicit offers and messages from adults that they didn’t share with their parents. Add those figures to the number of predators who use dating apps and it’s no wonder why parents worry about their kids online. Teenagers, especially teen girls, can meet men who claim that they’re the same age when they’re much older. They may send sexual images to their online friends and feel blackmailed when those men threaten to share the photos on the web. With MSPY, you can save your child weeks of fear because it allows you to see any potential threats before they become serious. You probably looked at cell phone trackers before. If you’re like most parents, you probably decided not to use one because you wanted to give your child some freedom and wanted to make him or her trust you. No matter how much you trust your child, you can’t always trust those who come into contact with your kid. The majority of children who were sexually abused suffered abuse at the hands of someone they knew, including a beloved coach or a loved one. MSPY has a helpful background mode that ensures your child doesn’t know it’s there or running. It takes around 10 minutes to install and then offers remote viewing. You don’t need to have the phone in your hands to see what your child does with it. Some of the things that you can see with MSPY include: Using MSPY is easy because of how quickly you can download it to a child’s phone. As long as you can get that phone away from your teen for a few minutes, you can add the tracker to the phone without him or her knowing it. When used with younger kids, it’s helpful to let them know that it’s there because of the SOS feature. If your child is ever in a dangerous situation, they can hit this button. It sends an alert to the parent and constantly monitors the location of the phone. Teens can use this button too. With MSPY, you get complete access to another person’s phone. Not only can you view photos and text messages saved on that phone, but you can view content that the user deleted too. If you have a teen dating someone without your approval, you can view where that teen is as well as any messages they sent. MSPY is also perfect for the parents of young kids with their first cell phones. You can monitor their activities and make sure that you approve of everything they do online. MSPY can also make parents aware of any bullying that their kids experience too. MSPY does a great job of helping parents identify the signs of bullying. With so many tracking apps and products available today, no one would blame you for wondering what sets MSPY apart from the pack. One reason why so many prefer it is that it offers more help and support for parents. Both the app and the website can educate parents about the dangers of bullying. You’ll see videos online that feature some of your kids’ favorite social media stars talking about the bullying they experienced as well as what kids should do if they experience bullying. The makers of this app turned to education experts for help designing it. Those experts talked about how kids today bully others and the issues associated with cyberbullying. The makers used that advice and feedback to design a new app that allowed parents to use modern technology when protecting their kids. Some of the features found in this app specifically look for signs of bullying and send warnings to parents that let them know when to act. Unlike similar apps that just monitor cell phones and text messages, MSPY goes a step beyond to monitor the popular apps that kids use too. From WhatsApp and Viber to Snapchat and Facebook, it lets you monitor all the top apps. Signs of Cyberbullying in Kids MSPY is a tracking app that you can use on an iPhone or Android phone, though some users found that the Apple version lacks some of the features found on the Android version. It works with jailbreak phones as well as traditional phones that you bought from a specific provider. Though we’ll go over how to install it later in our MSPY review, we wanted to make sure that you understand where you can use this app. You can use this app on any phone belonging to someone in your family as well as all your family phones when you opt for the family plan. Let’s say that you and your spouse divorced and share custody. While you trust your former partner to look after your children, you might still have some doubt in your mind about what happens when they spend the night away from home. MSPY lets you use your phone or computer to pull up that user’s phone and view what they’re doing at any specific moment along with everything they did since leaving your home. With this app, you can even make sure that your former spouse took your kids to the same places they claimed. MSPY is a tracking app designed for any parent who has concerns about what their children do, especially their online activities. While it’s natural for kids going through puberty to watch adult videos and visit websites to look at sexually explicit images, it’s not natural for younger kids to do the same thing. This can be a sign of sexual abuse and indicate that someone you trust took advantage of your child. Using MSPY allows you to see everything your child watched and viewed on the web as well as everything they did through messages and online chats. MSPY can also help you: Another advantage of MSPY is that it lets you limit what your children can do online. If you find that your kids visit certain websites that they shouldn’t, you can block that site. The phone will never allow the user to visit it again. MSPY helps you monitor the relationships that your teen has with others and ensures that they have healthy relationships. Though you can do many things with MSPY, you must take a look at some of the top features of this app. Those features let you see if it can do everything that you want and how it will help you monitor your kids. With MSPY, you can: Another advantage of MSPY is that it lets you limit what your children can do online. If you find that your kids visit certain websites that they shouldn’t, you can block that site. The phone will never allow the user to visit it again. MSPY is different from other tracking apps because you can only use it with the unique Control Panel. You can’t simply head to the app store and look for it either because the app is not available through any of those stores. Once you choose a subscription and pay for the service, you can download the app through a link and sync it to your Control Panel. Before installing it, you need to do a few things to the phone you want to track, including: As soon as you log in, MSPY will take you to the Setup Wizard, which helps you set up the app. As long as you follow the instructions on the screen, you should complete the process in less than 10 minutes. With MSPY, you can set up your online account first and then add the app to a phone. We included a link below to help you buy MPSY. When you visit that website, you need to pick the subscription method that works best for you, which you can base on the number of people in your family or how many phones you want to monitor. You also need to update your payment information to show how you’ll pay for the plan the first time and when it comes up for renewal. Once you complete this step, you’ll get an email with a link where you can download the app. The features that you can use will depend on what type of phone you have. After adding MSPY to a phone, you can then use your log in details to access the Control Panel. This allows you to view any details you want about the phone and switch between more than one device. The Control Panel allows you to use geofencing and set up boundaries for your child and view the call log of the phone as well as the messages, photos and calls sent from it or received. As long as you keep track of the email address you used and your password, you can log into the MSPY Control Panel from any phone or computer too. Do You Need to Jailbreak a Phone to Use MSPY? You do not need to jailbreak a phone to use MSPY, but this will give you access to all the features that you want to use. While this will void the warranty on your phone, you can restore the factory settings later if you need to use that warranty. After reading about MSPY, you might wonder if it only works for adults. While thousands of parents use it to keep track of their kids, others use it as a way to keep track of their spouses or partners. Finding out that your spouse is in the middle of an affair with another person can break your heart and cause you to file for divorce. This can include a physical affair with someone they meet and share moments with in real life as well as emotional affairs that take place online. MSPY can help you gather evidence of that affair that your lawyer can use later, including: Cheaters often use their jobs as a way to explain away their affairs. They claim that they need to work late when they head to a partner’s home or meet someone in a local hotel. With MSPY, you can find the exact location of that phone and see where your partner is to see if they are truthful. This app can help you gather the same evidence that a private investigator would find. Lack of interest in affection and sexual activities Spending more time away from home Hiding their phone from you Making excuses why you can’t join them on trips A small but growing number of people use MSPY as a way to keep track of and monitor their workers. During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, a large number of business owners invested in the app and installed it on the phones of their delivery drivers. Though many people didn’t want to go outside, they still needed groceries and other supplies delivered. This app allows you to see where the drivers are and make sure that they don’t get distracted on their way to customers’ homes. It also comes in handy if you have employees who you feel waste time at work. Some of the common ways that employees waste time at work includes: Though you legally cannot use tracking apps on employees’ personal phones, you can download MSPY on work phones. Any employee who uses a phone for work must agree to follow your rules. MSPY is a legitimate app that when used on smartphones can tell you what an employee does, the websites they visit, apps they use and where they are on a work trip. MSPY is legal to use in most situations, including on a phone belonging to a minor child. It is also legal to use on phones belonging to adults if they know you installed the app and will use it. If you read our MSPY review and still aren’t sure if this is the best tracking app for your family, you can try it out first through the free demo that the developers offer. To get the free demo, you need to visit the official MSPY website and sign up for an account. You will then enter the credit card or payment method that you want to use and ask for the demo. The developers will send a link to your email address that allows you to download both the Control Panel and the MSPY app. Once you access the Control Panel and add the app to a phone, you can use any of the features that interest you. With the MSPY free demo, you can view messages sent to and from the phone along with photos sent and received. It also gives you access to call and chat logs and can show you how long that phone was connected to the internet. The free demo lasts for a full seven days after you sign up. Once it expires, the site will automatically charge the credit card on file for the subscription plan that you selected. If you cancel your account before the seven days are up, you don’t and to pay. Now comes the time in our MSPY review where we talk about the pros and cons of the child tracking app to help you decide whether to buy it. The easiest way to see why it’s worth the price is with a look at the app’s best features and what you can do with it. When you use MSPY on an iPhone or iPad, it saves all the data that you want in the cloud. You can view chat logs, phone calls, messages and photos in the cloud from your linked computer and keep backup copies of that data too Though we looked at other MSPY reviews to find some of the cons, we had a difficult time finding complaints about the app. One problem that a few people reported was that the company didn’t offer refunds. A woman claimed that she used the app for four days and realized that it wasn’t for her. The company charged her credit card for the full annual plan price and refused to give her a refund. A few others had similar complaints, especially among those who used the free demo. When they tried to cancel their accounts before the demo expired, the company still charged them at the end of the term. We also found some complaints about the price, which is higher than other tracking subscriptions cost. If you want to change your plan, you need to contact customer support over the phone or through email. Some found that it took days to get a response through email, which is why we recommend calling the company at (855) 896-0041 and speaking to someone directly. Another problem you might have with MSPY is when you want to make changes to the app itself. This will require that you use the app on the phone, which you might not have access to at the time. When you click on this link, you’ll visit the official website where you can choose the best subscription plan and buy MSPY. With the Basic plan, you can choose from three subscription options. This plan costs $29.99 per month when you sign up for the monthly plan. If you sign up for the three-month plan, you’ll pay only $19.99 a month. The cheapest option is the yearly plan that drops the price to just $8.33 per month. With the three-month and annual plans, you need to pay for your total service upfront. To get all the top features, you’ll want to invest in the Premium plan that can cost as much as $69.99 for the first month. This allows you to use the features and see if the Premium plan is worth the cost. You can also opt for a three-month plan for $39.99 a month or the annual plan for $16.66 a month. The site also offers a Family Kit that some call a good value. While you pay $479.97 a year, this plan includes full monitoring of three devices for a full year. MSPY also has plans available for phones and devices that you didn’t jailbreak, which cost the same as the Premium plans do. MSPY allows you to monitor some of the popular apps that teens and kids use today, including: WhatsApp Facebook Messenger Snapchat Tinder Though MSPY ranks as one of the top tracking apps for parents who want to watch their kids, there are alternatives that you might like. One is XNSPY, which is compatible with Android and Apple phones. You can choose a Premium plan for $12.49 a month or a Basic plan for $8.33 a month. This app monitors offline activities and keeps track of messages sent and sites visited. When the phone connects to the internet later, the app will send all that information to you for viewing. Another option is Spymaster Pro, which is available for as little as $7.99 a month. This app offers monitoring of the same chat apps, including the dating and hookup app Tinder and messaging apps such as WhatsApp. It works with iPhones using iOS 13 or higher and Android phones running Android 10 and higher. This is one of the only tracking apps we saw that monitors kik too, which is popular on college campuses. You can add extra tracking to the basic plan for an additional $4.99 a month to track photos and emails sent and received as well as track the phone’s accounts on Instagram and other websites. MSPY is the app for parents who don’t want to worry about their kids every time they leave home. Not only can you use this for teenagers who hang out with friends after school and kids who walk or ride their bikes home from school, but you can use it to keep track of students in college and children who head to camp for the summer. While most tracking apps simply show you where the phone is when you look for it, this app goes much further. It lets you view the photos that your child sends and gets from others, the websites that they visit and the apps that they use. With the MSPY plans, you can track one phone or choose a family plan that offers monitoring of three devices. No matter where your kids go or what they do when they hang out with friends, you can keep tabs on them and make sure that they are safe. Even shy and quiet kids can go a little crazy when they get away from their parents. With MSPY, you can keep an eye out for the threats that your kids face, make sure that they act appropriately and identify predators that can cause them harm.

Thereafter, these teenagers spent precisely 7 hours 22 minutes on average per day, using nothing but social media websites or apps. Despite the fact that Internet has proven to be a great boon for youngsters all across the world, providing them with an effective means of free education and communication, it has also enabled them in way to interact with complete strangers who may or may not be really safe to interact in the actual world.

You can then simply log into your account, through any web browser on a phone, desktop, laptop etc. and go through all the retrieved information, at your convenience. Easy monitoring in 3 simple steps You can follow the below provided 3 simple steps and start monitoring your child’s device without any hassles. Step 1 – Choose a subscription Your 1st step should be to choose a subscription plan on the mSpy website, based on the specific features you require in the software. Thereafter, you must provide your payment details and complete the purchase. Once you’ve done that, you will receive a confirmation email in your inbox. Step 2 – Install mSpy on the target device The welcome email sent to you will contain an installation guide, which will help you easily set up the mSpy app on the target device. Step 3 – Begin monitoring After you have successfully installed mSpy on the target device, you can log into your control panel on the mSpy website and start viewing the retrieved data, through an easy to use dashboard.   Monitoring and Blocking Of Websites This mSpy feature allows you to monitor which all websites your child or target user has been visiting, even the pages they have bookmarked. Not just that, the app can instantly update you when any specific keyword gets typed into the mobile phone. Such functionality can be immensely helpful for parents and allow them to better understand what their kids are searching for and watching on the Internet In addition, you get the ability to block websites of your choice, provided that the monitored individual uses any of the popular web browsers like Safari, Chrome or a native Android browser. Information Retrieval and Managing Key Functions From/On The Target Device The app gives you the ability to retrieve important information related to the target mobile phone, through your dashboard. The retrievable information includes: phone’s model, operating system details, memory details, version of the mSpy software, whether the target is rooted/jailbroken or not, cellular service provider, last time when phone was synced with the dashboard and the remaining battery life. mSpy app also make it easier to manage some important functions on the target device remotely, through the mSpy dashboard. These functions include: disabling the mSpy app on the target mobile phone, removing all logs, remotely rebooting the target phone, remotely locking the target phone, unlinking the target cell phone from the mSpy service, restarting mSpy app by sending a ‘777’ text message, exporting the logs on the Control Panel for storage purposes and wiping off all the data from the target device in case it gets lost or stolen. Managing The Target Phone’s Settings Using the mSpy’s control panel you can decide the target phone’s default behaviour. Post that, the application will continue working based on your defined settings, until you explicitly make any changes. For instance, if you choose to set everything to ‘Auto Update’, every bit of reported data will get automatically uploaded to the mSpy’s control panel. Since uploading all the information, that too frequently, can impact the data usage and battery life of the target phone, you can specify which all information must be uploaded, based on the internet connection being used. For instance, videos being large, must be uploaded only when the device is connected to a reliable Wi-Fi connection. Apart from that, you can also define the update intervals for location information and data. The smaller are these intervals, the more frequently updates will happen. It’s important to find the right balance, so as to avoid the target phone’s battery getting drained too fast. The recommended update intervals are 30 minutes for general information and every 2 minutes for the location data. Tracking Text Messages  mSpy offers the ability to track all the outgoing and incoming text messages on the monitored phone. Your dashboard will show you the exact phone numbers, timing and content of the text messages. It’s also possible to view any text messages which have been deleted from the target phone. Tracking Outgoing And Incoming Calls  It’s also possible to keep a constant track of the outgoing and incoming calls on the target mobile phone, through the mSpy Control Panel. You can keep yourself informed about the total number of calls, names, phone numbers, durations and timings of the calls. As in case of text messages, you can even retrieve this data if the target user deleted their call log. Not just that, you can block phone calls coming in from certain phone numbers or contacts; and can even block incoming calls in entirety during a specific time period. To give you an example, you can block all incoming calls on your daughter’s mobile phone, from 10 PM to 7 AM next morning. All this can be configured right from the mSpy dashboard. Accessing Contact and Calendar Details With mSpy you can go through the contact names, email addresses, phone numbers as well as the physical address details, stored on the target mobile phone. Additionally, you can go through the calendar schedule of the target device too, enabling you to stay on top of any scheduled tasks, calendar entries and/or pre-scheduled meetings. Tracking Physical Location  Keeping a track of the physical location of the target user, is an extremely important feature offered by the mSpy app. This tracking is done through GPS technology, and the phone’s location remains trackable within a distance of 20 meters. What’s even more impressive is that you can view this location information on a map for a specific time period. In the event that the target device can’t connect to GPS, this info can also be retrieved via closest wi-fi network. Tracking Emails  It’s possible to track all the outgoing and incoming email messages using mSpy. All these details get uploaded in a log file, and are accessible through the mSpy dashboard. You can learn about the receiver/sender’s email address, the time as well as the content of the email. Just as in case of SMS text log and call log details, it’s possible to retrieve all this info even if the monitored user has cleared their emails. Geo-Fencing Considered an extremely important feature for parents, geo-fencing enables you to define certain forbidden and safe geographic zones for your children, through the monitored cell phone. There is no limit on the number of such zones you can define. The target device will automatically update you about the frequency and timings of instances when a fenced-out zone was visited / exited by the user. This information can be sent to you even via an email. Parents all over the world actively use this feature to protect their children from potentially harmful places. Through mSpy’s geo-fencing, you can easily define safe zones around your child’s school, home and various other places s/he visits on a regular basis too. Monitoring Installed Applications  Every application installed on the target mobile phone will get shown on the mSpy dashboard, enabling you to easily open or block access to it, for the target user. It proves to be a very effective feature in ensuring that the kids don’t use any apps which they’re not supposed to, and could be potentially harmful for them. Monitoring Of Multiple Instant Messaging Apps Nowadays, there are all multiple ways in which you can communicate with other mobile phone users, both through voice calls and instant messages. We are referring to popular IM apps such as Google Hangouts, Snapchat, WhatsApp, Tinder, Telegram, LINE, Viber, iMessage and Skype. mSpy enables you to track the data exchanged on all such apps, read the exchanged text messages, browse videos & pictures, and generally monitor all activities happening on the concerned app. Keyword Alerts How about getting an alert each time your child enters some offensive word into his / her mobile phone, for instance keywords like alcohol, porn, drugs, sex etc. It can come in pretty handy to prevent your kid from getting into any kind of unwanted situation or habit. You can basically enter all the keywords you would like to track, and mSpy will send you instant notifications upon usage of any of them. Key Logging  When you use this mSpy feature, the keyboard on the target mobile phone gets replaced by an mSpy keyboard, without the target user getting to know at all. Thereafter, the software can create a log of all the keystrokes on the target device, and keep you updated about all the activity happening on it.  mSpy offers support for a wide variety of mobile phones and tablets including: No, using mSpy is not considered illegal as long as you ensure its ethical usage. The app was primarily created to help concerned parents keep an eye on their children, and to empower employers by enabling them to keep a check on their workers’ productivity.

        "desc": "MSpy is a spy app that allows you to monitor what another person is doing on their phone. It can be installed on your child's phone or an employee's phone to track their movements, see what messages they are sending and check the numbers they are calling and receiving, among other things.",
        "body": "I know how frustrating it is to wonder what someone is doing on their phone and how it might be affecting you.  Maybe it’s your kids doing who knows what on the internet or social media and calling people you told them to stay away from. Maybe it’s your employees taking their work hours to go waste time and spend your dime browsing the internet or meeting friends.  Most of us have been there at some point, wishing we had some way to monitor what the people in our lives are doing on their phones and making sure they are doing what they’re supposed to. My name is George Courtney, and for years I have been reviewing tech products- phones, laptops, PCs, and bunches of apps to go with them. I’ve been doing the research and testing stuff out to save you money and to help you avoid making a purchasing decision that you will regret.  I’ve been looking into cell phone spy apps recently, comparing major hitters like Cocospy, KidsGuard, FlexiSpy, Spyic and more. Out of all the ones I looked at, mSpy is definitely my top choice. A lot of the mSpy reviews tend to agree with me. The great customer service that backs up this product, coupled with a fast install time and low price make it the #1 monitoring tool in my book. I’ve reviewed it for you, and my goal is that you will feel more informed after reading through my detailed research and probably come to the same conclusion that I did about mSpy.  MSpy is a spy app that allows you to monitor what another person is doing on their phone. It can be installed on your child’s phone or an employee’s phone to track their movements, see what messages they are sending and check the numbers they are calling and receiving, among other things.  Of course, the benefit to this is that it helps you find out what the other person is doing and can also deter them from engaging in unwanted behavior. It’s helpful for getting kids to stop going on websites they shouldn’t be on or to find out who they are talking to on their phone. MSpy helps businesses track their employees’ whereabouts and activities and account for them, increasing productivity and decreasing wasted time and money.  If your business is suffering because of poor employee performance or you suspect that your kid may be doing something dangerous or wrong, then installing a spy app like this on their phones can be the right way to go. This is an excellent tool for parents and employers. Just keep in mind that unless the target phone belongs to your child who is under 18, you have to notify the person that you are installing the app. You cannot monitor them without their permission, if they are not your kid or they are 18 years or older.  This cell phone tracker app is bristling with features. I love how much stuff it does, and I think you will too. Now, like I said, I have looked at a lot of other monitoring tools, trying to find the best spy app for iPhone and Android. I know what it takes to make a good spy app, and mSpy has all the right stuff. With this app, you get all the following features: You get all of this when you sign up for the monthly plan, and you can enjoy updates as they happen, which will keep you right on the edge of the latest spy app technology. Because mSpy is one of the most popular spy apps, it gets lots of support and is regularly updated to ensure that it stays inconspicuous and effective.  I want to talk about some of the good points and the downsides to using mSpy. I’m trying to be as fair and unbiased as I can with my review, so you are getting both sides of the mSpy experience presented to you in this review, which is not necessarily what you would get with all mSpy reviews.  Pros: Cons: It’s important that you get a spy phone app that works for the device you want to target. The device you use to monitor on doesn’t really matter, as you can monitor from the mSpy website directly. The portal and control options are all available there. However, you need to ensure that you install the app on a device that is compatible. So, let’s talk about compatibility for a moment.  With the mSpy program, you can sign up for a monthly subscription plan that will cover a single iOS compatible device, like an iPad or an iPhone. The app developers do a great job of keeping up with any updates and changes to the iOS operating system and ensuring that their app still works and still delivers all the same options, even as the iOS system evolves over time. The spy app works with iOS 7+, and the device doesn’t need to be jailbroken.  It’s the same for Android devices. You can use mSpy on Android 4+, and this is frankly the best spy app for Android. You don’t even need to root the app to the device, if you don’t want to, so it can be used easily and conveniently in a way that works best for you.  Testing this app out on a variety of Android and iOS devices yields the same results. It offers unprecedented levels of monitoring and oversight while working invisibly and without any issues.  The level of support offered by the customer service team for the app is exceptional, and they will help resolve any problems and answer any questions quickly. I don’t think you will run into any serious compatibility problems, but you may have some issues every now and then with how to make the app work best with a specific device, and the customer service team will be able to help with that. Most of the features the app offers will work fine with any Android or iOS device that is listed as being compatible with it. That’s any iOS system from 7 on up and any Android system from 4 on up.  Now, some of the features will not work unless you root your Android device- in particular, the instant messaging monitoring. Most other functions will work fine without rooting.  If you have an iOS device that isn’t either version 7 or higher, then you can enable iCloud functionality, and the app will work with the device just fine.  Would you like to keep a better eye on your children? A lot of parents are wondering what their children are up to on their phones and may be concerned about who their kids are hanging out with, who they are calling, what kind of messages they are sending, and who their phone contacts are. Some kids won’t tell parents that information willingly, so having a parental control app like mSpy can help parents get the oversight they want. You might be worried about how your kids are spending their time online or on social media. mSpy tracks their posts and activity on social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and more. You can easily tell what they have been up to and who they are friends with.  It also monitors webpage activity, so the parents can see where their kids are spending their time online, how long they stay on specific websites, what their internet usage is like during school hours, and more. All of that internet browsing activity will be detailed for parents’ easy perusal. The activity reports are saved on mSpy’s database, and once the parent inputs their mSpy login credentials, they can access all of that whenever they like. MSpy doesn’t just track what the kids are doing on their phones; it also tracks where they are going. This is an excellent GPS tracker for kids, and it shows their current location whenever the parent checks on the mSpy website. This is one of the best features that mSpy reviews will talk about, because it’s so helpful and so good at enabling parents to monitor their kids beyond just checking their calls and messages.  The GPS tracking is so detailed that it can show where the phone has been, including the full route to their current location. That’s very useful for checking in on the kids and finding out if they have been staying where they are supposed to or if they are going to areas that they aren’t allowed to.  Even if kids are hiding things from you, you’ll still be able to find it on the mSpy app. You can see deleted text messages, find out what they have listed in their calendar as upcoming events, and spy on their secret internet activity. Nothing can hide from the powerful parental control features that mSpy offers for parents who want to protect and oversee their kids. This phone tracker is designed to be simple to use, and that is something I really appreciate about it. Not a lot of parents are going to want to take the time to learn complicated technical functions and long, involved setup steps. Once the app is installed on the target phone, you just need to log in to the mSpy website and see what calls are being received onto the phone. There are lots of features offered by this robust phone tracker app.  It can show you which calls are coming in and which ones are being made from the phone. You can see the entire phone number listed and see contact details, if the number is saved in the phone. You will get all the same information about the call that is stored on the target phone itself. That’s very handy for if you want to track who your kids are talking to or whether your employees are using their company phone for company calls or for personal calls.  One of the best features that comes with this phone number tracker is the ability to tag contacts and phone numbers. If there is a person on your kid’s contact list that you feel suspicious about or that you have told your child not to call or answer calls from, then you can tag that person on the mSpy website. When a call from them comes in or your child calls that number or messages them, you will receive a notification. It’s a great way to keep tabs on who your kids are conversing with and whether they are being safe and responsible with their phone.  Enjoy an Exclusive discount with mSpy, just use this mSpy Coupon Word Code “discover” to get an extra 20% off. Click Here To Visit The Official mSpy Website There are two steps to installing this mobile phone tracking app. First, you need to install it on the phone or tablet of the target device. It does not need to be installed on your own phone. Bear in mind that the app download is free, but to get the features, you will need to sign up for a monthly or annual plan.  The next step is to log in to the mSpy website. There will be a secure online control panel there that you can use to access phone records, messages, social media platforms, apps on the phone, GPS location tracker, and more. All of that will be controlled from the website and the control panel there. It is designed to be easy to navigate and use for anyone, regardless of their technical expertise. That’s really all there is too it, and like I said earlier, you may need to ensure the phone is jailbroken or the app is rooted to the device, depending on the device and what you want to do with the app.  You don’t have to worry about the target phone user seeing the app on their phone and getting notified that you are watching them. This is a very discreet app that operates invisibly, so unless your kid knows to look for the app, they will have no idea that they are being watched. If you are looking for the best phone tracker app without permission, then this is a good one to choose. It will be practically invisible, giving you information without tipping off your kid.  One of the big deciding factors for parents and employers about whether they want to use this GPS tracker app or not will be the cost.  The basic plan starts at $29.99 a month, but you can save money by signing up for a year of service, which will cost $99.99 a year. Take note that these prices are current at the time of this writing and they could change.  What do you get with the basic plan? You’ll be able to monitor calls, text messages, emails, the calendar, target keywords, browsing history, GPS location and contacts. You also get free updates and support and are notified if a SIM card is changed.  If you are willing to pay a bit more, you can take advantage of the Premium package. This gives you all the same features as the basic package, but you also get geofencing that alerts you when the target phone leaves designated areas or enters designated no-go areas. You can also block websites and incoming calls. It also lets you wipe the device or lock it remotely, giving you greater parental control. In addition, you will have access to Snapchat and be able to monitor activity there. This is the most robust package available and one you should consider for any phone where the target is very active and may need more extensive monitoring of their activities.  If you don’t jailbreak the phone, you will have access to far more limited features. You won’t be able to monitor emails or location, and you won’t receive regular updates or be able to block access to anything. There will be some other features you’ll miss out on well, so you definitely want to consider jailbreaking the target phone if you are going to get the most out of mSpy and get your money’s worth for the subscription plan.

Click Here To Visit The Official mSpy Website You can find lots of mSpy reviews to there to read up on if you want to find out how customers feel about this product. When I was looking at consumer reviews, I found mostly positive things that people were saying. There are definitely some negative reviews here and there, but they aren’t nearly as common as the positive ones. I’d say this product has a generally positive reception from customers, and here are a few sample from consumer reviews to demonstrate my point.  Andy Kane wrote that the product is great and the support team is even better. He raved about how helpful the support was that he received and was impressed by how friendly and knowledgeable the staff was.  DM said that he received great support help and that the product is good for monitoring text messages and more.  Kellie wrote that her experience with mSpy has been mostly favorable and that she has used the product for over a year. Like the other reviewers, she praised the customer support and how responsive they are when there is an issue.  You can find bunches more reviews like these if you look online. MSpy has been around for a while and has had tons of customers in that time, many of which have posted public reviews for those interested in making a purchase. If you’re on the fence about whether to get mSpy and whether it is the best phone tracking app, then reading some reviews may help you make your decision.  This is one of the questions that comes up in a lot of mSpy reviews. Consumers wonder whether they are getting an app that is legitimate both legally and technically. They want to know if it really works and if it is legal to use. Let’s answer both of those questions. I’ve tried out a lot of spy apps and monitoring apps in my tech reviews. These are very popular among parents and employers who want to track people on their phones and find out what they are up to. Some of them only work occasionally, some of them are rarely updated, and some of them only work on either iOS or Android devices. If mSpy had those kinds of issues, I think it would be fair to ask if it’s legit. However, that’s thankfully not the case. The support team is constantly working to resolve any issues and ensuring that regular updates are released to deal with changes to the operating systems. Apple and Google are always making changes to their OS (operating systems), namely iOS and Android. Not all of the parenting and monitoring apps can keep up with that, but mSpy does an admirable job of staying on top of the changes as they occur and ensuring that the software is still working and still legitimate even after an update is issued.  There may be some small kinks to work out and technical issues that need to be sorted out after an update, but they get on that quickly and make sure that things are running smoothly as soon as possible, and the mSpy reviews reflect that fast response and helpful customer service support. The mSpy app also works well on either Android or iOS devices, like iPhones and iPads, so no matter what you have, there is an app and a subscription plan designed to work with you. You can even change the target phone and still receive support from the same dedicated team. To answer the question of legality and whether the app is legally okay to use, the answer is slightly more complicated. Monitoring apps like these are perfectly legal in the right circumstances. You have to own the phone that you are targeting, so if it is a company phone or a child’s phone that you purchased (or the child lives with you and is under 18), then you technically own the phone. That’s true even if someone else is using the phone.  So, it’s legal for you to jailbreak the device and download the app on there. However, there may be a legal question about whether you need to tell the target user whether the app is there and whether they are being monitored.  If the targeted user is an employee, then you need to make them aware. You are required by law to tell them that their conversations will be recorded, their location will be tracked, their messages will be read, and their browsing activity will be overseen. In other words, you have to have their consent, and if you don’t, then you are in some murky legal waters and may be engaging in illegal activity. If the targeted user is your child, then they need to be 18 or under for you to install the app and monitor it without their permission or knowledge. If they are over 18, they need to be told that the app is there and they need to know that you are monitoring them remotely.  You can use the app on any other phone you own, but in cases other than those listed here, you need to notify the person who is using it. They need to be aware that their usage is monitored.  Here are some questions I frequently see being asked about mSpy. I hope your question is answered here.  Q. Can mSpy work invisibly? A. You can use mSpy undetected, making sure that the target is not notified of its use. You will be able to monitor their activity without their knowledge, because the app does not notify the phone user that it is there and it is actively monitoring them. Q. Can mSpy be installed remotely? A. It is not possible to install this app remotely. You must have the target phone in hand to jailbreak it or root the app, in some cases. You also need to download the app onto the phone physically, but after that initial installation, you should not need to touch the phone again to use the software.  Q. What interferes with mSpy’s monitoring? A. The app will not be able to send you information if the phone’s internet is turned off, and it may not send information if the phone is roaming.  Q. Can I change the subscription license to another phone? A. Yes, you can move licenses from one phone to another. If your kid gets a new phone or you give your employee a new phone, you can always move the license to the new phone and keep the same subscription package.  Q. Will I be able to get a refund on mSpy if I have problems with it or don’t like it? A. If it doesn’t work, you can take advantage of the 14-day money back guarantee. There are limits to the refund, and you might not be able to receive a refund for any subscriptions beyond the first one.  Q. Is it legal to monitor someone else’s phone? A. It is if they are your child, you own the phone and they are under 18 years of age. Otherwise, you need to let them know that you are monitoring them and that the app is downloaded on their device. You also have to own the phone you are targeting and monitoring for the app to be legal for you to use. Is this the right GPS phone tracker for you? Only you can determine that, but I hope that after reading this review you feel more informed. I’d recommend mSpy as one of the best ways to monitor messages and calls, track a cell phone location, or block dangerous websites on a remote phone. By signing up with a subscription with mSpy and downloading the app, you can take advantage of great customer support, regularly updated software, powerful monitoring tools, and more. This is one of the best parental control apps available and makes it so easy to track phone location accurately and look at web browsing history, among other things.  I highly recommend mSpy for its extensive features, great price, and strong customer support. It is a valuable tool for parents who want to protect their children and watch what they are doing on their phone. It’s also helpful for employers who want to ensure that their employees are using their phone for business and are not creating a conflict of interest with their on-the-clock activities.  I don’t think you will find a monitoring spy app that gives you more options at such a low, competitive price, and don’t forget all those positive mSpy reviews. Remember that you can save money by signing up for longer periods of time. Other spy apps might be a bit cheaper, but they aren’t as well supported and fully featured as this one, which makes mSpy the #1 choice for phone monitoring as far as I’m concerned. I think you will agree once you give it a try. "

In general, installing mSpy looks something like this: As we have mentioned before, there might be some slight differences in the installation process depending on the target device type. Here are dedicated mSpy installation instructions for both Android and iOS operating systems. If you were wondering how to install mSpy remotely on Android without the device, we’re sorry for being the bearer of bad news – but remote installation of mSpy is impossible on Android devices. You’ll have to obtain physical access to the target device if you want this process to succeed. However, you can install mSpy software remotely on iPhone cell phone devices if you have the target’s Apple ID and password. In terms of Android devices, though, here’s how installing mSpy looks like: Step 1: Create an account on mSpy’s website and complete registration Step 2: Choose the target device type – in this case, opt for ”Android phone” Step 3: Choose a suitable package Step 4: Enter payment details and finalize the purchase Step 5: Obtain physical access to the target device Step 1: Open Play Store on the target phone Step 2: Open the Menu in the top left corner Step 3: Make sure that the Android phone is fully charged and connected to the internet Step 4: Locate the Play Protect feature and click on it Step 5: Click on the gear icon in the top right corner Step 6: Disable ”Scan device for security threats” Step 1: Open Google Chrome and paste the link you received via email when you purchased a subscription plan Step 2: Complete the captcha security check Step 3: Click Download then Ok Step 4: Go to Open>Settings>Allow from this source Step 5: Download the app and press open TRY MSPY Step 1: Accept the license agreement Step 2: Allow all mSpy app permissions when prompted Step 3: Enter the registration code to install the app Step 4: Press Complete installation Step 5: Go to your control panel and start monitoring all activities. When it comes to iOS devices, the installation process is quite similar with one major exception – you can install the app remotely. However, to do so, you’ll have to obtain the target’s iCloud credentials. Also, this won’t work if your target didn’t enable their iCloud backup. Because mSpy offers a solution for both jailbroken and non-jailbroken devices, we’re going to divide this guide into two sub-categories. Let’s start by explaining how to install mSpy on a non-jailbroken iPhone. Step 1: Go to mSpy’s website, register for an account, and choose a suitable subscription package. Make sure to opt for a no-jailbreak version. Step 2: Open your newly received email and confirm your mSpy account and subscription. Step 3: Get ahold of your target’s iCloud credentials. Log into your mSpy dashboard and enter the login details. Step 4: Let mSpy sync all the data. Soon after it’s done, you’ll be able to see all target phone activity in real-time. Step 5: If you don’t have iCloud credentials, then open the download link from the confirmation email and install it on the target device. Step 6: Follow on-screen instructions and complete the installation. Step 7: Once done, hide mSpy’s icon from the app drawer. NOTE: mSpy’s no-jailbreak version offers fewer features compared to the jailbreak version. That’s because jailbreaking gives you superuser access which bypasses previously imposed system restrictions and controls. TRY MSPY The installation process on jailbroken phones is somewhat similar, though much more complicated. First, you repeat the signup process we’ve mentioned in the mini-guide above aimed at non-jailbroken iPhones. Then, follow these steps: Step 1: Open the Cydia app on your iPhone. All jailbroken devices have this app – it allows you unrestricted system access which you can use to customize various phone settings. Step 2: Go to the Sources tab and press Edit. Step 3: Open the Add Source option. Step 4: Enter mSpy’s download URL which you received via email during the initial sign-up process. Step 5: Cydia will run an automatic update. Once done, click on the Return to Cydia option. Step 6: Open the newly installed source. It’s called Mtechnology LTD Depository Step 7: Open All Packages > iPhoneInternalService > Install > Confirm Step 8: Cydia will download and install the product automatically. Step 9: Once the installation is complete, click on the Restart SpringBoard option. Step 10: Locate the mSpy icon on the homepage and proceed with the installation. Carefully follow all given instructions. The final installation process lasts for 2-3 minutes. Step 11: Go to mSpy’s website and log into your control panel. You’ll see all target phone activity there. TRY MSPY The whole point of spy apps is secrecy and invisibility. So, if you’re wondering how to install mSpy on my wife’s phone or how to install mSpy without my teen knowing, here’s a quick rundown of the process.  If you’re an Android user, you’ll have to install the app physically. Follow the instructions given in the Android Installation section above. Once done, make sure to hide the app from the drawer by following mSpy’s on-screen installation instructions. For iPhone users, the process is identical except for the fact that you need the target’s iCloud credentials. If you have them, you’ll be able to install the app fully remotely, without ever touching their phone. Then, like with Android, follow mSpy’s on-screen installation instructions to hide the app. Technically, mSpy is undetectable, unless your target knows exactly what they’re looking for. The creators of mSpy have cleverly disguised the app by naming it ”Update service” and adding a generic icon that resembles your plain old in-built system apps. If you follow the installation instructions carefully and complete the registration successfully, you’ll also manage to hide mSpy from the app drawer. So, unless your target looks for ”Update Service” specifically, there shouldn’t be any issues with mSpy detection. Another thing to note is that mSpy may be detected via antivirus software or Play Protect. However, during installation, mSpy prompts you to disable Play Protect on the target device, so there shouldn’t be an issue there either. Since mSpy strongly focuses on user experience and convenience, they’ve ensured that the installation process is very simple, quick, and straightforward. If we combine all the steps, including the registration and installation, it shouldn’t take longer than 3-5 minutes to complete. If you come across some issues, make sure to reach out to mSpy’s customer service. Anjelica Rivera  Anjelica has almost 10 years of experience in cell-tracking, online monitoring, and cybersecurity.

The download link can be found in the control panel. Simply login to your account and then download the mSpy app onto the device you want to monitor. 2. Do I need physical access to the phone to install mSpy? Yes, you need physical access to the phone to install the mSpy app on it. That’s because you have to download the installer file and manually install it. 3. Do I need to root the Android phone before installing mSpy? Don’t worry, there’s no rooting required – you simply download a hidden tracking app and you’re good to go. However, if you want to monitor their instant messaging chats like Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, you’ll have to root the phone. 4. Will my child know mSpy is installed or running? Is it detectable? The only way they will know is if you chose the “I’d like to keep the icon” option while installing the app. If you didn’t choose that option then nothing will be displayed to notify the user.

I am not sure if the software works or not since I was unable to get in installed. You advertise a 10-Day Money-Back Guarantee. Since I found out the software would not work on my Iphone5 I immediately requested a refund and was told I was not eligible for one. This is obviously a shady company and have many complaints listed with the BBB. Wish I had checked before my order. You must jailbreak the iPhone you want to monitor before installing the application. It is impossible to download or install mspy if you can’t jailbreak the target iPhone. This means that mspy won’t work with non-jailbreak iphone. Jailbreaking is simple and easy, and you can use evasi0n to do it. Do not go anywhere near mspy! I have it and the problems are many. I have had the phone for about 10 days and (among other problems) can see no photos or videos. I have tried to work with support but just get told to “wait” and the downloads will come, or it is my internet connection (I have verizon FIOS, no connection or speed problems with any other device or application), or some other run around. When I asked for a refund within the first 7 days I was refused. If you do get this software, do not expect a refund no matter what. Again, I currently have this software and it does not work. I am a very unhappy customer and warn everyone against purchasing this product. Hi David, I am sorry to hear about your problems. In general, I found that mspy works well with almost every smartphone and tablet. If you have received logs normally and then they stop suddenly, there may be various reasons: 1. The internet is not working on the target phone. 2. There are no such activities. 3. The phone is turned off or roaming. 4. If you are not able to use Whatsapp, Skype, Viber and Facebook features because the target Android phone is not rooted. I have never received logs normally. ‘1. The internet is not working on the target phone.’ The internet is working fine on the target phone. Getting emails, facebook updates with videos, video messages on apps like vine, I can surf the web no problem. The phone is on the WiFi connection in my home, which is Verizon FIOS, I have no connection or speed issues on any of my devices using this WiFi connection. ‘2. There are no such activities.’ This is a child’s phone and is loaded with photos and videos. NONE have ever been downloaded. It has been 2 weeks. Also I have made new test photos and videos to see if that would work. Nothing. ‘3. The phone is turned off or roaming.’ The phone is sitting in my house turned on and on a charger. I have rebooted it several times. Again it is receiving calls, texts facebook updates, videos etc 4. If you are not able to use Whatsapp, Skype, Viber and Facebook features because the target Android phone is not rooted. It is an iphone 4s jailbroken running cydia I am a software engineer myself. I don’t expect everything to work perfectly. I have no problem with a little trouble shooting to get things to work. I have a very typical system: Dell laptop running windows 7 on a Verizon FIOS WiFi connection. Nothing exotic. As said above, the phone is an iphone 4s connected to the WiFi getting traffic. I have contacted support a number of times. The majority of the time I was simply told to “wait”. One time I was instructed to do some reboot and turn off the connections for an hour and turn back on, which I did numerous times. No change. After I purchased I found the link above that shows the many complaints. Clearly I am not the only one experiencing these problems. Hi David – Many thanks for your feedback and sharing your experience. Can you please tell me which iOS version you are currently running? mSpy is currently not compatible with iPhone 4S running iOS 6.1.3 and above. i am using the MSPY from last 6 month. i was very much happy from the mspy service. but from last 15-20 days ago, mspy updated their web interface. after this update, it become worst and lot of issue are there. no imessge log, call log, (almost all features) updating and missing the msgs. i give now zero start rating. i contact to mspy technical. i am sorry, but infect they are giving very stupid and unlogical reply. please request to MSPY, back to your previouse version or i advice to all new purchaser not to spend money on it. it is rubbish. Hi, I’m experiencing the same problems today. In fact, I noticed that a few days ago, the site was quite long in uploading data. Yesterday, mspy operated a site maintenance for more than one hour and since then, I have no logs for sms, calls, key logger, locations. All I can get are ambient recordings, call records (even though they don’t appear on the dashboard, amazing !). I’ve been trying to sort this out with their support team, and just like you, they told me to send a hidden sms, which I did, they told me to wait for about 2 hours for the data to be loaded…. Still, nothing is happening. I’ve just contacted them but have no answer. You say it’s possible to request to get me back to my previous version ? Thanks. This should be fixed now! Please let me know if you continue to have problems. Thank you. For everyone out there I tried several companies and mspy was by far the best. If your not sure ask about a free trial and you can see how it works with your phone! WARNING to everyone out there the worst company out there is SPYBUBBLE!!!! Do not get this software it is a total scam. The features rarely work and you have to constantly reboot the target phone!!! It is by far the worst software and company out there. BASED in INDIA. THEy are HORRIBLE!!! Mspy is awesome compared to any other company trust me!!! Thank you for your valuable feedback! I changed from spy bubble to mspy because of additional feature, record surroundings, photo spying etc. Have had mspy since July and these additional features have never worked for me. I was given several explanations for record surroundings not working i.e. connection interrupted with call etc. I tested them myself, they never worked…ever! I was ok to continue with mspy, just having other regular features, sms, call, location logging etc. Until recently. Somehow my target’s phone lost connection with mspy. I was advised to re-install it. I tried, lots of times, was unable to connect. Mspy told me that my internet connection must not be strong enough! It was strong enough before. I have full strength internet and sitting right next to my router when I try to connect! I am at present, paying for nothing! why im no longer have the call/sourroundings recordings features anymore ??? i been a premium customer for 2 months and i just extended for 1 month that was the reason i been extended it one more month but now im thinking of cancel the suscription its not longer useful to me if someone knows wats wrong please let me know thanx I purchased mspy and it worked great. I read, listened and saw everything. The target had no idea until I disclosed the information to them. Unfaithful, not loyal and very dishonest.. Glad I did this although I knew too much because this software actually gives you access to everything.. Glad I did this because it saved me from a lifetime of misery.. Thanks Mspy program was the best , but now it has been the worst since they cancelled Call Recording and sourrounding call and I really not advise anyone for this program. I had the premium subscription for six months. When I went to renew I saw the note that call recording and remote sound recording was no longer available. I did not and will not renew until/unless they make these features available again. Hi All, The “Call Recording” and “Record Surrounding” features are no longer available within mspy app due to the legal case. However, there are still more than 25 features in mspy that you can use to track a cell phone. And I received an email from mSpy Team. Here is what it said: mSpy cares about the needs and concerns of its customers. That’s why we have long been providing our services to parents whose aim is to keep their children safe and to employers who seek to manage their workers productivity with their knowledge and consent. In keeping with this theme, we wish to reiterate that in no uncertain terms do we endorse nor promote the use of our software for purposes other than which have been expressly stated. Please remove any content that suggests otherwise. You may refer to our website for a more detailed description of the approved uses of mSpy tracking software. We would like to draw you attention to the fact that monitoring software, like mSpy, still remains legal. The charges against the affiliate mentioned and, possibly, one of the developers were brought on the basis of advertising an ‘eavesdropping device’. We have made sure mSpy clearly positions itself as a parental control tool and business monitoring solution that can only be used with prior consent obtained. Thank you, mSpy Team I don’t think people buy this software “just for fun”. At least for me, it’s to much money involved + the installation process…. You were the best untill you made this stupid decision. How come all the other spy programs still have the recording features?? To bad they can’t compete with you in “over all”. Mspy is easy to use, price worthy, reliable – you name it! To end this; thanks to Mspy record surroundings my Children still have their mother – I’m still alive! I found out about my charming husbands plans, Before it was to late….. Have a nice day everyone! If the target has a data plan for the internet how much does it’s charge for this software to be on his phone? Mspy did not notify me that call recording & surround recording feature are not available anymore. Mspy did not even send me a reminder email about my subscription expiry. my subscription was expired last month & I did not know. I did n ot receive any email even in my junk folder. Reason could be anything. I had last six month subscription for only 57 euros (£46) but I has been increased to 136 euro (£108 inc. vat) which is totally rip-off especially when these two features are not available. company becoming greedy & greedy .. Hi..I purchased an mSpy 3 month subscription. Within hours, and not even attempting to set up the program, I emailed and tried to cancel my subscription due to the 10-day refund policy clearly listed on the front page of their website. I was clearly told, no refund would be offered as I should have read their refund policy. They expect a consumer to dig through their website to find this policy – one would think an * next to the “10-day refund policy” stating exceptions apply would be a nice touch. After further review of this policy, they have listed everything possible to never have to give a refund! I understand if I used the product, but they would be able to see that I have clearly done nothing with it. Their only response is they will give me a free month on the backend of my subscription. Where is that a benefit to me when I have clearly asked for a full refund? Maybe, make me pay for 1 month of service and return the other 2 months…. really mSpy.com.. horrible customer service, unethical company, and a report to the Better Business Bureau and RipOffReport will be next. Can someone please tell me in easy to understand steps how do I work this software? Do I download mspy to my computer or to the phone I’m trying to track? Lisa Hi Lisa, For more details on how to download and install mspy app please refer to http://www.mspyreview.net/how-to-install-mspy/ Hello, it seems I lost connection with target phone which is the phone of my child who is in Dutchland. Normally he connect by Wi-Fi. Thanks Hi! I would like to know if you can actually link back previous target phone because I accidentally hit the unlink current device while I was browsing it? Do I need to reinstall it again to continue using mspy? HELP please!!!!! I’ve been a user of mspy for the last several months and i really dont have much complaints.. Although it was a bit tricky installing and it occasionally loses some of the data meaning I know the person I’m spying on sent me a text message and i didnt see it appear on the logs, for the most part their product works and i cant imagine what i would do if i didnt have it. I would like to see more feature added but you cant go wrong with the price and their support is real good. Overall im satisfied with this product. I was able to download this app on an android cell, worked good for a week, and the updates stopped….I “CHAT” with them and sent the phone a “777” message, didn’t work….then they said I had to re-download the app on the target phone, so when I was able to get to the target phone at 2:30 am, I re-downloaded the app….it worked for another week and the same problem….the 777 message didn’t work, and now I’m not able to get into the phone, it now has a request for “PIN” number….so I have been requesting a refund, no responses…I only had the app tracker for less than a month. It looks like the app was somehow disabled by the phone’s user. When you are installing the mspy app, you can choose to hide the app icon on their phone. Did you do that? Hi, I’m experiencing the same problems today. I’ve been trying to sort this out with their support team, and just like you, still nothing is happening. I’ve contacted them and they had me unlink the target phone and re verify and connect again. Program says it updated, but the call logs and the text messages have not. Also does the non jailbreak program show deleted texts and phone calls? Because I was lead to believe it did. But it has never showed deleted texts or phone calls in the logs. Comments are closed. "

A message on inSta False advertising! Product does not work with iPhone. Company difficult to work with and refund refused. Read 1 more review about mSpy It started out great when the target phone was android. I was using it as monitoring software for my teenager. The selling point was the key logging, text logging and most importantly remote access. Website says that it is compatible with any iPhone or android. I recently upgraded the target phone to an iPhone SE, which per the website is compatible. As far as iPhone I was allowed to use only a fraction of the features. I contacted tech support who confirmed that none of my needed features are available for remote access meaning that I would need to get the phone and do a data dump every time. I politely explained that this is the opposite of the advertisement and since the software is no longer doing what it was supposed to I’d like a refund for the balance of my subscription. Their reply is that the limited software abilities are beyond their control and they cannot issue a refund. How is it beyond your control when you advertise all these features on “any iPhone, iPad or android”? They offered to freeze my account so I would still have the time on my subscription but that’s not really useful as I don’t intend on returning my family’s brand new iPhones to get androids in the foreseeable future. I have saved the chat logs with tech support stating that the features do not work. Bottom line if the target phone is android it works just okay.

        "body": "It is not difficult to find spy software that does not work as intended. There are a lot of choices but not every app provides the desired solution. Instead of spending on software that does not work, it is better to depend on the one that does as promised. While I would not say that Mspy is the perfect solution, it does is one of the best available in the market.  Mspy is a spy software that runs in the background of the target mobile phone, helping users monitor messages, phone calls, location, social media, internet browsing activities, and much more. The app is very useful for parents, employers and various other users. The Mspy is designed to be precise and prompt in collecting data from the target device. It triggers the data collection every five minutes. The information collected is then presented through a control panel that can be checked with the help of any browser. Working for almost every android and iOS platforms, including phones and tablets, the software is very reliable. Mspy can also be used for non-jailbroken iOS devices.  The more we dig into getting clear information on what is legit and what not, we find ourselves even more tangled. Some are even confused if spying is justified on a moral ground. Although spying software must not be used for illegal applications, its popularity is still restricted, given that it does interfere with the privacy of the target device, hence, staying as an offensive act to some.  However, wouldn’t being a parent, you would consider safety of your child above every other feeling? With cyber bullying being the major reason for many kids getting into depression and even committing suicide, being extra vigilant has become required responsibility of parents. Also, with so many ways of defying business security, keeping tap of employee’s online activity is also crucial.  If these are what you seek for, you must think of a spy software. If not, and you wish to misuse the data of the device for revenge or competition, you may put yourself within legal standing. In short, your usage of the software would decide if your intentions are justified or not.  Mspy may not be the most advanced spy software in the market, however, it is a well rounded solution. You can consider Mspy as one of the easiest and feature rich mobile monitoring apps. The software offers competitive price over those offering advanced features that does not account for usual use-case scenarios. Right since its release in 2011, the software has earned huge recognition among the users and is very popular. Those who have been using the software have liked the way it works. The recorded information can be accessed from anywhere and from any device using a browser.  Our comprehensive review would allow you to understand the different benefits of the app and the few challenges that may seem negotiable.   Mspy, as mentioned above, helps track the activities of the phone device pertaining to the phone calls, instant messages, social media activity, location data, and a lot more. The best part is that the target mobile owner would not even know about the particular app installed on the phone. It runs in the background, undetected. Even if the app is not installed secretly, the mobile owner would not be able to make any changes to the existing setting of the app. The software cannot be manipulated through the target device. This makes it even more reliable and accurate. Once the collection completes, the data logs are sent to the online dashboard, often called as the control panel. Users can view everything and assess the information from here using any browser with an internet connection.  Mspy, as any other spy software requires an internet connection of the target mobile for sending over the data to the dashboard. Hence, the target mobile must be equipped with WIFI or data connection to facilitate the process. However, the app isn’t location dependent. So, the target device can be monitored, irrespective of its location. Download Mspy Mspy is backed with various useful and advanced features. Here are some of the cool ones that make Mspy so desirable. Keylogging Capabilities: Many would think why such a feature would ever be necessary when you have the access to the messages and texts. Not everyone knows that the applications are compatible with the existing version of the different software present on the mobile device. After an update is released, it takes time for monitoring companies to provide related update for growing the compatibility with the new version of software in the target device. For example, if WhatsApp releases an update, Mspy would no longer be compatible to record the messages exchanged over it. But keylogging would store all those messages. So, until the Mspy comes with the latest update to accommodate changes in WhatsApp, you can check the messages with the help of this cool feature.  Saves Battery Usage of Target Device: the reason why many spy tools are caught even when working in the background is their high-power usage. The battery starts draining sooner, alarming the device owner of the spy software. So, all the gain of working in the stealth mode is taken away. However, this is not the case with Mspy. Using an intelligent monitoring system, the software utilizes resources wisely. Hence, assuring battery levels closer to the same level at most of the times. Automatic Reports Generation: Many users often complaint of receiving scattered and meaningless data formats when collected by the spy software. This makes the entire hassle worthless. When working with Mspy, you do not have to worry about that. Not just the data is collected, these are arranged and organized in the most informative ways. Hence, you find all your information pre-formatted to provide you with necessary details without requiring any extra work. Website Tracking: The feature makes it easy for parents to block the adult websites for their kids or assist employers in monitoring the time utilization at work by their employees. Many employees, during office hours hang on their favourite social media websites and ignore work. The feature is really helpful in website tracking and taking necessary action against the unusual browsing.  Export of Collected Data: Instead of making it impossible to export the collected data like many other alternatives, it lets user export the data on their personal devices. The data can be collected and saved on the computer and mobile phones and can be accessed offline as well. This feature enables user to present the data to anyone, anywhere even when the internet connection isn’t available. Dashboard Accessibility: The Mspy software is equipped with many useful features. And, this one sure provides huge benefits to the users in customizing the spy app as intended. Users can change the settings of the app through the dashboard. For example, if you do not want see few recordings, such as location tracking, you can toggle to other features. And, keep the interface clean and manageable. Why to include unnecessary information and making accessibility difficult and complex, when you can choose what you need and what you do not. Geo Fencing: This feature is designed especially for parents. Using geo fencing, parents can choose specific locations that they wish to allow their kids to visit. In case, your children visit any place out of the location barrier, you will receive an alarm to parent’s device. This will help parents take specific action.     Download Mspy Mspy is compatible with non-jailbreak iOS (all versions) and android based devices (Android 4+).

If you buy something through a referral link on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission at no extra cost to you. Learn more This mSpy review is an honest look at one of the world’s most popular spy apps. mSpy is the top selling parental control and monitoring app in the world. mSpy software monitors mobile phones (Android and iOS) and computers (both Windows PC and macOS). But is it the best? This review of the mSpy cell phone tracker will help you decide if it’s the right solution for your needs. Hey there, I’m Jason.  Over the last few years I’ve spent well over 120 hours testing and reviewing cell phone spy apps.  In that time I’ve learned a lot about which ones work, and which ones are a complete waste of money. Here’s what you’ll learn in this post: When I needed to monitor the phone of a loved one I found out the hard way that smartphone security is REALLY tough to beat. Phone spy software companies make lots of big promises about how simple their apps are to install and use.  The truth is, most of them are unstable and have terrible tech support. And if you’re stressing out over what someone’s doing on their phone, you don’t need to waste money (and time) on a phone tracking app that will NEVER work. mSpy is one of the best spy apps because it offers lots of features without jailbreaking or rooting the target device. In fact, mSpy was my favorite spyware app for several years. But to be completely honest, mSpy has fallen behind. My current favorite spy app is uMobix.  uMobix offers more features (especially for iPhones) than mSpy and they offer LIVE phone support. Here’s a quick comparison between the two.  There are a FEW cell phone surveillance apps out there that work well, and mSpy is one of them.  This isn’t to say I didn’t have some frustrations with mSpy. But most of my issues with mSpy were handled very efficiently by their tech support team. More on that in a bit.. While mSpy is a bit more expensive than other monitoring apps, it offers a great balance of features, customer service, and stability. If you’re interested in moving forward with mSpy at this point I would encourage you to: Now that I’ve gotten that off my chest, on to the full review… The functionality built into this app is quite comprehensive. Below I’ll show the features for both the iPhone and Android versions of the mSpy app. Now days monitoring text messages isn’t enough. There are dozens of ways to communicate from a smart phone or tablet using any number of social media apps.  mSpy also allows you to monitor some the most popular social apps. This includes:  One of the most popular features for parents and employers is website monitoring and blocking.  This feature allows you to see which sites the target device visits, pages they have bookmarked, and can even notify you when specific keywords are typed into the browser. It’s especially nice for parents that want to be able to keep an eye on the content their kids are viewing. You can’t always be there peering over their shoulder to make sure they’re not getting into trouble.  With site monitoring you can see for yourself what they’re looking at.  mSpy also allows you to block specific sites. The blocking feature is very useful, but it is somewhat browser dependent. If the owner of the phone uses Chrome, Safari, or the native Android browser you’ll be able to block sites, but if they download third party browsers like Opera, they can get around this feature. From your control panel you’ll be able to see all incoming and outgoing calls from the target phone. You’ll see call times, duration, their name if they are a contact on the target device, as well as the total number of calls. You control when calls are deleted from the dashboard’s call log. If the phone’s user deletes their call log, you’ll still have a history regardless of what is stored on the phone itself. There are two additional functions that make mSpy a truly powerful app.  One of the most frequent questions we get is how to get text messages from another phone sent to mine. One of mSpy’s most powerful features is the ability to track all incoming and outgoing text (SMS) messages from the target device. From your dashboard you’ll be able to see the phone number, the time, and the text message itself. Just like the call log, you control when messages are deleted from your dashboard. Even if the owner of the phone deletes text messages you’ll still be able to see them. As with texting, email is another area where a child or employee can get into trouble. mSpy allows you to see all incoming and outgoing email messages in a log file located on the dashboard.  Here you’ll see the email address of the sender/recipient, the time stamp of the email, and the content of the email itself.  This log file operates the same way as the call log and SMS text log. Even if the user deletes the emails you’ll still be able to see all the information in your dashboard. From your dashboard you’ll be able to view all of the target device’s contacts. You’ll see names, phone numbers, email addresses, and even physical address information. You’ll also have full access to calendar events and schedule of the target device. This allows you to see scheduled meetings (and any associated details), all calendar entries, and any scheduled tasks (and their details). Any time a new appointment or contact is added you’ll see the entry reflected in your dashboard within minutes (depending on the update schedule you set). Another powerful feature of the mSpy app is the GPS tracker. Using the phone’s built in GPS tracking system you’ll be able to instantly track a phone’s location to within about 20 meters.  In addition to seeing their current location you can also see a map of their location over a specified amount of time.  By utilizing wi-fi you’ll even be able to track the phone when it’s not capable of receiving GPS signals. In addition to the mSpy GPS tracker, you can also set up restricted zones for the target device. The number of zones you setup is unlimited. The phone will automatically log when and how often each of the zones is visited. You can even have the phone send you an email notification letting you know when specific zones have been entered and exited. This is an extremely powerful feature for parents. You can setup a “safe zone” around your home, your child’s school, and any other areas they normally visit.  If they leave one of these safe zones mSpy’s GPS tracking will notify you immediately. It’s the best peace-of-mind you can buy. From your dashboard you’ll be able to see quite a bit of information about the target device. Some of this is just informational, but there are some key functions built in as well. Here are the stats you’ll be able to see: There are also some key functions you can perform remotely using your mSpy control panel. These include: From this section in your control panel you’ll be able to set the default behavior for the target device. Once this is setup the software will operate with these settings until you change something. You’ll want to be sure to set everything to “auto-update” to that all of the recorded information is automatically sent to your control panel for viewing.  Because uploading all of this information on a regular basis can be taxing for both the battery life of the phone and the data usage of the phone you can tell mSpy which types of information to send over specific connections.  Videos, for instance, are quite large. You can tell the app to only upload videos when the phone is on wi-fi rather than a cellular connection. This will keep the mSpy app from chewing up the data plan. You can also set the update interval for data and location information. The lower the setting, the more frequent the updates will take place. It’s important to strike a balance that doesn’t drain the battery of the device too quickly. In most cases updating data every 30 minutes and location information every 2 min is fine. In your mSpy dashboard you’ll be able to see all of the installed applications of the target user. From this same menu you can choose to block or unblock access to the application. As new apps are added the list will be updated in your control panel. This helps you to ensure that your children aren’t accessing any apps that could be harmful to them or their phone. It also helps ensure that employees are staying on task and aren’t using apps that could be a liability for you or your business. With the Keylogger feature the default target keyboard is replaced with a mSpy keyboard that tracks all keystrokes. You can force mSpy to always load it’s keyboard by selecting “Force Keyboard” button in your control panel. This function is helpful for monitoring for certain language usage or logging usernames and passwords to websites. If you need to learn how to hack a cell phone this is one of the most powerful features out there. Would it be useful for you to get a notification every time a specific word or phrase was used on the target phone? Drugs, sex, porn, alcohol, or any keyword of your choosing can be set to enable an immediate notification to you and your phone.  Simply enter all of the keywords you want tracked and you will be notified any time it is used. mSpy shows you text messages, apps, browsing history, and more to let you know ANY time it sees this word or phrase. The mSpy dashboard allow you to view all photos and video taken with the target phone. You will also see date and timestamp for each image/video. Pictures can be viewed as a thumbnail or in full size. Videos can be viewed in their entirety. mSpy has all the same capabilities of the top spying apps on the market: tracking websites visited, incoming & outgoing phone calls, text messages, social media conversations, keystrokes typed, app and website blocking, and location tracking.  But UNLIKE many spy apps, you DON’T have to jailbreak or root the phone to get all this information. Why is this important? Because it will save you time, the headache of trying to crack a phone, and it won’t void the warranty of the phone. The mSpy app is relatively easy to install and setup. The user interface is easy to navigate and it gives you access to practically EVERYTHING on the target phone. All of this is backed up by mSpy’s 24/7 email and/or chat-based customer service. While the installation of mSpy is more involved than some apps that are simply downloaded to the phone, the step-by-step instructions that are VERY easy to follow.  We’ll dig more into that a little further down the page. First let’s dig into what this monitoring app gives you as a parent or employer.  mSpy is a spying app designed to monitor a target phone, tablet or PC/Mac. Once installed it allows you to see the target device’s call log, SMS text messages, internet browsing history, GPS location, emails, media (pictures & video), instant messages, and several popular social media applications.  Through your web-based dashboard you’ll be able to view all of this and more safely, securely, and without the knowledge of the target phone user. This dashboard is available from either a computer or mobile device. There are a variety of uses for an application like mSpy. Some customers use it to keep tabs on their children. There are plenty of good reasons for kids to have smartphones.  Unfortunately you can’t always be there to make sure they’re not using it in ways they shouldn’t. mSpy performs very well as a way to keep track of your kid’s online activities. In fact I rated it one the best parental control apps on the market. It gives you the ability to monitor what websites they go to, who they talk to and when, who they text with, and who they connect with through various social media apps.  It also allows you to physically track the phone at any give time to make sure they are where they said they would be. As a parental control app, mSpy is a solid choice. It allows you to keep close track of everything that happens on your child’s phone including internet usage, call history, contact names. Here is a great article if you are specifically interested in apps for parental control. When you’re running a business time is money. You hope that your employees are trustworthy, but sometimes it pays to have a backup. And as a business owner you could be liable for their behavior and actions. With mSpy you can make sure employees are arriving on job sites on time and leaving when scheduled.  You can track how much time they spend on the phone each day and who the text with while at work. You can monitor the websites they visit from their device to make sure they’re not doing anything that might cause harm to your business’s reputation. While most of us practically LIVE on our cell phones, occasionally they do get lost or left behind. mSpy is a great way to quickly see the exact location of your lost phone. You can even remotely disable it so no one else can use it. You can choose to keep mSpy completely hidden on the target phone. This makes it invisible to the phones owner. mSpy’s dashboard allows you to see their exact location 24/7. You can see who they text with, who they call and when, and see who they chat with in certain popular social apps.  Most reviews paint a pretty glowing picture of the mSpy cell phone tracking app. I’m leading off with my frustrations because I want you to know what to expect. When I needed to secretly monitor the mobile phone of a loved one I signed up for an account with mSpy. Their instructions said that I would just need their iCloud user ID and password. But when I logged into their iCloud account I found out that a 2-factor authentication code would be sent to the user’s phone.  So much for being secret 🙁 Luckily I was able to get the code from their phone without being noticed. QUICK UPDATE Since I wrote this review, mSpy has updated their instructions AND come up with a way to set it up without ever touching the target phone. My other frustrations came after getting everything setup.  These frustrations aside I’ve been pretty impressed with the app itself, and SUPER impressed with their customer service.  The support staff (Mike Hoover especially) are incredibly patient and will literally work with you for as long as it takes. For iPhones they offer the most features of anyone in the industry and: The Android version of their app is also very powerful, but like ALL Android spy apps, it requires a couple minutes of physical access to the phone to install it. This means you WILL need a few minutes of physical access to the phone. mSpy is a mobile monitoring application that is installed on a cell phone and allows you to monitor phone calls, social media activity, instant messages, location data, and more. Once mSpy is installed on the phone it runs in the background and is completely hidden. For Androids the app must be installed on the device itself, requiring physical access. For Apple devices you will need the Apple ID and password of the target user so that mSpy can access their iCloud account. Regardless of whether or not it is hidden, there are no settings that can be manipulated from the app on the target phone. Once installed on the target device the mSpy has access to just about everything on the phone or tablet. It collects this data and sends it to your online dashboard for viewing at your convenience. From here you’ll be able to view text messages, voice call logs, contact details, and a lot more. mSpy utilizes the internet connection of the phone (wifi or 3G/4G/5G) to send all of the data to your dashboard. This means that the target device must be internet capable. It is not location dependent and operates anywhere in the world so long as there is a connection to the internet. Getting mSpy is easy. Simply follow one of the links on this page and you’ll be able to see all of the features and capabilities for yourself.  There are several different purchase options. You can buy it outright for a one-time fee or if you’re looking to spend a bit less you can pay for it monthly. Before you go any further in the process it’s important to know if your intended target device is compatible with the mSpy app. Getting the most functionality out of the software requires that you root an Android phone or jailbreak an iPhone.  Many of the latest versions of the iPhone won’t allow you to jailbreak them. Here is a list of compatible devices and compatible operating systems. mSpy no longer offers a version for a jailbroken iOS device. If you are looking to monitor a jailbroken device, you’ll first need to reset it to factory defaults. 1. mSpy is compatible with all versions of iOS2. iOS Device must be connected to the internet3. No physical access required if you have the devices iCloud login credentials4. Physical access may be required if iCloud backups are NOT enabled 1. Requires at least Android 4.0 or higher2. Device must be connected to the internet3. You will need physical access to the device4. Tracking of instant messengers, Facebook, Facebook, Skype, Viber, WhatsApp, Wi-Fi Networks and Gmail requires rooting the target 1. Must be running Mac OS 10.7 Lion, Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, OS X 10.9 Mavericks, OS X 10.10 Yosemite, OS X 10.11 El Capitan2. Physical access to the computer is required 1. device must be using Windows XP x32, Windows Vista x32, x64, Windows 7 x32, x34 or Windows 8, 8.12. Physical access to the computer is required for installation There are several different packages available from mSpy. For phones that have been rooted or jail broken they range from the “Basic” package to the “Premium”. There’s also a no-jailbreak package which has a more basic installation, but doesn’t offer as much functionality. Below is a breakdown of each plan, it’s cost, and features. As you can see there are significant costs savings for paying either quarterly or annually. As a paying customer you will have access to either 24/7 email support (basic package) or 24/7 email and chat support (premium and no-jailbreak packages). Their technical support team can help you with any issues that come up during installation or use of the product. You should expect to receive an email reply in less than 30 minutes. Chat wait times are significantly less. We never had to wait more than 2 minutes for a support representative to respond to our chat requests. No review would be complete without covering the installation of the mSpy app itself. The process is slightly different depending upon which device you’ll be targeting and which package you purchase. If the device you want to monitor is an iPhone and you don’t want to have to jailbreak it, you can install mSpy Without Jailbreak. You will need the users iCloud credentials to proceed with the installation.  Start by logging into your Control Panel. Choose the installation option that matches your equipment. Then follow the step by step instructions.  Make sure that iPhone backup is enabled. iPhones backup to the cloud once a day, but they must be connected to Wi-fi, plugged in, and locked.  To check that backups are enabled go to the targets Settings menu, then make sure that “iCloud Backup” is set to “On”. Then go to “Backup” and click the Backup Now button. This will synchronize all the target phone’s data with your control panel. The “Full Pack” is mSpy’s jailbreak version for iPhones an iOS devices. Here’s a resource if you’re unfamiliar with jailbreaking a phone. The first step to installing the full version of mSpy is to jailbreak the device. Refer to this compatibility table to make sure your device can be jailbroken. Many of the newer iPhones don’t have a jailbreak available yet. If this is the case with your target device, you’ll need to use the “No-Jailbreak” version of the software. To check the iOS version on the target device go to the Settings->General->About->Version. Once you’ve successfully jailbroken the phone you can go to your control panel dashboard and choose “iPhone” to continue the installation. You should expect the entire procedure of jailbreaking the phone and installing the software to take about 30 minutes or so. For installation on an Android device you will need to have physical access to the phone. From your control panel select “Android”. Then follow the step-by-step installation instructions. Androids do NOT require rooting for basic functionality of the mSpy app, but the enhanced functionality of monitoring of certain apps will require that the device be rooted. Once you’ve completed the mSpy installation procedure the tracking software will begin monitoring the phone immediately. From here on out all activity can be monitored from your control panel. There are literally dozens of phone and tablet monitoring apps on the market. mSpy has proven itself to be a leader by offering a solid, stable package that is very reasonably priced.  Yes FlexiSPY offers a few features that mSpy doesn’t such as call intercept and call recording, but for the money it’s the best app out there for monitoring your kid’s, employee’s, or spouse’s phone. Here are a few common questions that come up when trying to choose a phone monitoring app like mSpy.  There are several apps I would recommend instead of mSpy based on features and pricing. Here is my list of the best mSpy alternatives. Other comparable products include: While there are lots of people who have had bad experiences with mSpy, the software DOES work as advertised. Many of their customer reviews are less than flattering. Unfortunately many customers don’t read the mSpy return policy before making their purchase, struggle to get it working, and leave reviews saying it’s a scam. mSpy is completely safe. The different versions require different methods of installation, but both will have no impact on the phone and can be completely removed when no longer needed. When utilizing the jailbreak version of mSpy to track an iPhone, iOS versions 6 – 8.4 and 9 – 9.1 are supported. When using the non-jailbreak version it is supported on all iOS versions. For Android devices it must use Android 4+.  Windows computers running the following versions are supported: Windows XP x32; Windows Vista x32, x64; Windows 7 x32, x64; Windows 8, 8.1; Windows 10 MAC computers with the following operating systems are supported: Mac OS 10.7 Lion, Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, OS X 10.9 Mavericks, OS X 10.10 Yosemite, OS X 10.11 El Capitan Yes, so long as the device is connected to the internet mSpy will send information from the target device back to your control panel. Obviously you will experience delays whenever the device is turned off or is out of range. Yes, using mSpy is completely legal. However, there are a few caveats. You must be the owner of the phone. For example, if you want to monitor a phone that your company provides to your employees this is completely within the law. It IS required that you notify your employee that their phone is being monitored. Another example would be to monitor your child’s phone. At that point it’s up to you whether or not you let them know you’re monitoring their phone.  If you’re looking to install mSpy to monitor a spouse or significant other you suspect of infidelity, telling them obviously reduce the chances of catching them in the act. This is at best a grey area. Many would argue that it’s more important that they know for sure. Read more: Are Cell Phone Spying Apps Legal? mSpy doesn’t have to be “installed” on the target phone at all if it is an iOS device. It simply allows you access to all of the online backups in the users iCloud account.  Android phones still require physical access to the device, but the app remains hidden and invisible. mSpy now features a Family plan. All of the devices will be shown in your dashboard so that you can quickly change from one to the next. This is ideal if you’re monitoring a number of employees or several children. The Family plan also unlocks the most powerful features from mSpy. Technically jailbreaking an iPhone does void the warranty. However, by updating the iOS or resetting the phone to it’s factory default you can reverse the jailbreak. This will allow you to use the warranty should it be needed. During the installation of mSpy you decide how frequently the target device uploads it’s data. It can be set as low as ten minutes or as high as once per day. The higher the frequency the more drain the app will cause on the target device’s battery. If you’re using the app for tracking purposes it can be beneficial to have it update more frequently. Generally once every half hour is sufficient. Removing mSpy is very simple. For iOS devices you simply open the app click “Installed”, click “iPhoneInternalService”, click “Modify”, and then click the “Remove” option. For Android devices go to the “Phone Settings”, Security, Device Administrators, Update Service, Deactivate, Get Back to Settings, Apps, Update Service, and Uninstall. While mSpy offers powerful functionality, there are other options out there that don’t offer the same features but are also much less expensive.  We recently finished our FlexiSPY review and thought it was time to compare it to some of the competitive products on the market.

The app allows users to monitor and log activity on the client device.[1][2] mSpy was launched as a product for mobile monitoring in 2010 by a London-based tech company. In 2012, the application allowed parents to monitor not only smartphones but also computers - Windows and Mac. In 2013, mSpy became TopTenReviews Cell phone monitoring software award winner.[3] By 2014, the business grew nearly 400%, and the app's user numbers exceeded the 1 million mark.[4] In 2016, mLite, a light version of mSpy, became available from Google Play. In 2015 and 2018, mSpy was the victim of data breaches which released user data.[5] It was noted that since mSpy runs inconspicuously, there is risk of the software being used illegally. mSpy was called \"terrifying\" by The Next Web[6] and was featured in NPR coverage of spyware used against victims of stalking and other domestic violence.[7] In May 2015, Brian Krebs claimed that mSpy was hacked, leaking personal data for hundreds of thousands of users of devices with mSpy installed.[8] mSpy claimed that there was no data leak, but that instead, it was the victim of blackmailers.[9] In September 2018, Brian Krebs claimed and demonstrated that anyone could easily gain access to the mSpy database containing data for millions of users.

        "body": "Start monitoring today with a special 30% discount Mobile phones and social media are integral parts of a modern kid’s life. Researches tell that about 53% of children in the U.S. own a smartphone by the age of 11. And about 51% of teens aged 13-17 are reported to access social media at least once per day. Although the Internet opens the door to free education and communication, young people start interacting with strangers they would never approach in real life. When it comes to e-safety, kids can face hazards, such as cyberbullying, sextortion, and online harassment. What’s more, frequent use of social media can result in Internet addiction or depression (if a child fails to meet the social standards). As a parent, you need to keep an eye on your child’s smartphone activities. One of the best ways to do so is by using a parental control app, such as mSpy. If you want to know how exactly mSpy can prevent your children from being cyberbullied or groomed by online predators, read this review.           mSpy is a parental control app that makes it possible to track your kid’s online activity remotely. Available for Android and iOS, mSpy provides parents with clear insights into their kids’ smartphone usage. The basic features include tracking a child’s GPS location, call logs, and text messages right from your mobile phone. All the data collected from a target device is stored in a single place – the mSpy Control Panel. mSpy parental control app includes various features that allow monitoring of the following activities: Before installing mSpy, note that the set of features depends on the subscription. Some features, such as monitoring emails and Instagram messages, are available only within the Premium package and can require rooting a target device.  Although mSpy offers a diverse set of handy functions, it is cheaper than many parental control apps. You can choose among Basic and Premium subscriptions if you need to monitor a single device. The Family Kit solution allows tracking up to three devices simultaneously. You can clarify the mSpy price by contacting the customer support team. If you’re still on the fence, you can use the mSpy free trial valid for seven days. You can also access the demo version on the mSpy.com main page to figure out how the app operates.  Getting started with mSpy is simple. Depending on a target device’s OS, you need to follow a different sequence of steps to install the app. mSpy monitoring software is compatible with Android OS 4 and above. Before you start installing the app, you need to turn off Google Play protection. Here’s how you can do it: To launch the installation, follow the steps listed below: During the mSpy setup, you need to take a few more actions: To finish the installation, open your mSpy Control Panel. Fill in your kid’s information, choose the target OS, and activate mSpy using the Registration Code that you find there. After you press the Finish button, go to mSpy.com and use your mSpy login and password to access your account. You can now start monitoring your kid’s device remotely. Installing mSpy on an iOS device is even easier than doing so on Android. That’s because you don’t need to install mSpy manually on a target iPhone. To get started with the mSpy no-jailbreak solution, you need to know the target device’s iCloud credentials. To start with, activate iCloud backup on your kid’s device. Then, purchase the mSpy no-jailbreak package by following the link: https://www.mspy.com/buynow.html. Once the purchase is confirmed, you will get a welcome email with further instructions. Note that mSpy may need about 24 hours to download the data from a target device to your mSpy Control Panel. mSpy parental control app is designed to monitor your child’s phone remotely without them knowing. So, it’s pretty difficult to detect it on a target phone. There are no visible traces of its presence unless you choose to leave the mSpy icon on during its installation. It’s natural that you may be concerned about the legitimacy of using a monitoring app. However, the law allows you to monitor other person’s online device in two cases: What’s more, mSpy doesn’t support remote phone call recording, which is illegal in many U.S. states. So, using the app is entirely legitimate if you don’t violate another person’s privacy. mSpy is a parental control app that assists parents to understand their kid’s online activities better. If your kid experiences problems, mSpy can help you detect their source and prevent children from being bullied or harassed online.

Hi Mia, Thank you for your positive feedback! We are happy to know that mSpy brings you peace of mind! I have been using mspy from last two years since my son started going to high school. Because of mspy I was able to help my son recover from the tragic incident of cyberbullying that my kid was facing and if it wasn’t for mspy I would have never even known about it. I highly recommend that all parents should install apps like mspy so that can keep a track of their kid’s social life. Dear Mrs. Johnson, We are relieved to find out that the mSpy app helped your kid to recover from such a negative incident! Thank you for sharing your experience! I started using this app on the recommendation of one of my colleagues. Being a working mom I don’t get that much time to interact with my daughter but recently I noticed that she was spending too much time with her phone. I installed mspy and started monitoring her without even letting her know and got to the bottom of the cause. And I saved my daughter from becoming a victim of sexting all thanks to mspy.

I recently noticed a very peculiar change in my daughter’s behavior. She got addicted to her smartphone and all the time she was texting someone and when I used to ask she used to say it’s her friend but her behavior was suspicious so I installed mspy and started monitoring her texts and the thing that I was fearing happened. My daughter was talking to an unknown guy and they were even sharing pictures. I talked with her and warned her from the future consequences. All thanks to mspy I was able to save my daughter from becoming a victim. Hello Hermione, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback! We are glad that mSpy helped you to reveal who your daughter texts with! I’m the father of an Instagram obsessed daughter. These days everyone is crazy about posting pics on Instagram and having the maximum number of followers.

But, now mSpy has made it possible for me to track my son’s location through its build in GPS feature. Thanks to mSpy I don’t have to go through that painful phase again. Hello Sam, Thank you for your feedback! We really appreciate you taking the time out to share your experience with us. We hope your son is safe and sound! I have been using mSpy to keep a check on my girls because I’m well aware that teenage girls aren’t mature enough to differentiate between public and private. So, in order to save my girls from an incident of sexual harassment on the internet, I keep a thorough check on them and mSpy helps me do this in the best possible way. Being a mother I think that along with keeping a check on our kids we should also take them in confidence and guide them about the online predators who try to misuse innocent children especially teenage girls. Thank you mSpy for existing☺ and making internet secure for our kids. Dear Melissa, Thank you for your kind words! We are striving to make the Internet a safer place for kids of all ages and our customers’ satisfaction is our top priority!

Dear Emma, Thank you for your feedback! We are happy to hear that mSpy helps you to detect anything suspicious on your kid’s device.

We are constantly improving our software and striving to keep all the features running smoothly. We kindly recommend you to update mSpy on your target phone and contact our Customer Support in case of any further issues. I have been a fan of mSpy honestly. But, from a few couples of weeks, there are certain times when I stop getting any report from the connected devices. I contacted app support too but they are saying that my app is working fine. Don’t know what to do? Hello Paul, Thank you for your feedback! Our development team usually releases updates to adjust mSpy to the latest OS changes. We kindly recommend you to update mSpy on your target phone to keep it smoothly and timely reporting. mSpy is a good effort in making parenting easy especially in this technologically advanced world.

I have tried many other parental spying apps but I would mSpy is the best one I have used so far. There were minor issues and bugs but after the last update it has been fixed and the app is running smoothly. I would recommend parents to try mSpy as its UI is very user-friendly. Hello Henry, Thank you for your feedback! We are happy that you like mSpy! Feel free to contact our Customer Support in case of any further issues. I live in LA and the increasing trend of sexting among teens has been my prime concern. Being a mother of teenage girls, I started using mSpy to monitor my girls’ online activities. MSpy allows me to read all the messages they have received I can even view their deleted texts. Thank you so much mSpy ?. Hi Aboody, Thank you for your feedback! We are happy that our software brings you peace of mind! Having heard about the rising incidents of sextortion. I purchased my membership of mSpy. But, even after setting up safety protocols my daughter still received a random text from a guy who was trying to talk dirty with her. I mean what’s the point of using such apps if our children aren’t safe. Dear Shyann, Thank you for your feedback! mSpy does have a lot of features that help parents to ensure the digital safety of their kids. Unfortunately, we can’t completely stop strangers from reaching your daughter. Though, you can block incoming calls on your daughter’s phone and prevent unwanted numbers from calling her. If you noticed someone sending the inappropriate messages to your child, we kindly recommend you to ask your daughter to block the sender on her own phone. My overall experience with mSpy is not so good and I’m not satisfied with this app. Before buying the premier package, I inquired about mSpy and they claimed that my kids will be 100% secure online but the reality is different even with mSpy my kids are always complaining about bad stuff that pops up in between their cartoons and also while playing games. On the other hand, I haven’t received any alert from the app itself. If my children won’t complain I can never find out that the app isn’t filtering adult content. Dear Farrah, Thank you for your feedback! We are constantly striving to improve our software and exceed our customers’ expectations. We kindly recommend you to update mSpy on your target phone to keep it smoothly and timely reporting. Feel free to contact our Customer Support in case of any further issues. I had heard so much about mSpy but when I used it, it didn’t turn out to be anything amazing just like any other spying app mSpy is slow and unable to perform properly in unrooted devices. No matter which app you choose you need to root your android and if you’re an iOS user then jailbreaking your device is the only way out, unfortunately. Dear Rosina, Thank you for your feedback! Please, be informed that the Premium features of mSpy do require rooting target Android device. Our Customer Support team is always ready to help you to root the kid’s mobile phone. mAssistance support package includes rooting through TeamViewer, so you can have the target device rooted for you. As for iOS devices monitoring, it is no longer required to jailbreak the target iPhone and iPad. With No-Jailbreak subscription plan, you can monitor any iOS device without jailbreaking it. I started using mSpy when my youngest son started using YouTube for watching his favorite oggy and the cockroaches. At first, the YouTube content blocker was working but, after the recent update it’s not working at all and I saw my son viewing an adult add during the show. Really irresponsible of mSpy. Hi Eugene, Thank you for your feedback! We are constantly improving our software to ensure efficient mobile phone monitoring. Our Customer Support team works 24/7 to answer all your questions and make sure mSpy runs smoothly on your target device. Feel free to contact them in case of any further issues. I started using mSpy to track my son’s commotion but, the GPS features of mSpy stops working from time and whenever I register a complaint on the customer care, they assure me that it won’t happen again but again after few days the system stops working. You people need to work on your GPS feature. Hello Jason, Thank you for your feedback! We are constantly striving to improve our software and make GPS location tracking even more precise. That’s why our development team usually releases updates to adjust mSpy to the latest OS changes. We kindly recommend you to update mSpy on your target phone to make sure GPS location tracking feature works smoothly. The app was using just fine but after the latest update, something went wrong and now even after the time limit the Wi-Fi keeps on working on my children’s devices. Mspy isn’t doing what it is supposed to do. Dear Saba, Thank you for your feedback! Our development team usually releases updates to adjust mSpy to the latest OS changes. We kindly recommend you to update mSpy on your target phone to make sure all the features run smoothly. I wouldn’t recommend this app to anyone. My experience has been really bad.

We are constantly improving our software to make sure all the features are running smoothly. In case of any troubles, feel free to contact our Customer Support anytime. They will address your issue as soon as possible. I started using mSpy to spy on my daughter’s Instagram at first, I was able to access all her data. But now the app is continuously asking me to jailbreak my iPhone in order to get full access to my daughter’s install. Hi Sonia! Thank you for your feedback! Our development team usually releases updates to adjust mSpy to the latest OS changes. We kindly recommend you to update mSpy on your target phone to keep it smoothly and timely reporting. I’m using mSpy from past few months everything was ok but now my app is lagging and I’m not at all satisfied with it. It’s not properly monitoring my children’s social media accounts these days I have tried contacting app support but still no use. Really disappointed. Hello Andrew! Our development team usually releases updates to adjust mSpy to the latest OS changes. We kindly recommend you to update mSpy on your target phone to keep it smoothly and timely reporting. I’m Angela and I tried using mSpy after hearing a lot about it but, my experience has been quite bad with mSpy. First of all, it’s very complicated to set up in your device secondly they are literally no updates so, if you are having some issues you are stuck with it. Not at all worth the money they are charging for it. Hi Angela! Thank you for your feedback. Our development team is constantly improving our software and striving to make the installation process straightforward. But, we understand that customers may face difficulties while installing or setting up the app. That’s why we kindly ask you to contact our Customer Support in case of any questions. They will help you to install and set up mSpy. I heard so much about mSpy so I thought of giving it a try. At first, the app was working amazingly well but with the passage of time, it started lagging and becoming slow. Whenever I updated my OS same things happened. Overall the app is good but it’s not suitable for all OSs. Dear Augustus, Thank you for your feedback! Our development team usually releases updates to adjust mSpy to the latest OS changes. We kindly recommend you to update mSpy on your target phone to keep it smoothly and timely reporting. I switched to mSpy from my previous spying software as I don’t want to root my device but even here the problem exists. Mspy claims that you don’t need to root or jailbreak your device in order to enjoy full features but all false claims. The keylogger continuously asks me to root my device in order to enjoy full features. Dear Rexy, thank you for your feedback! We are sorry to hear that we confused you. However, we try to make it clear for our customers that the advanced features of mSpy require rooting target Android device. Unfortunately, you can’t use a keylogger on the unrooted smartphone. Our Customer Support will help you root the device you want to use mSpy on and instruct you during the process. Please, pay attention that we also have mAssistance package that covers the remote rooting of the Android device through TeamViewer. After updating my device to iOS 11.2 my mSpy app has stopped working properly. I talked with the customer care representative and they said that mSpy supports the latest iOS version but why my app isn’t working? Really disappointed with the response Dear Mark! Thank you for your feedback! Our development team usually releases updates to adjust mSpy to the latest OS changes. We kindly recommend you to update mSpy on your target phone to keep it smoothly and timely reporting. After using mSpy I can definitely say that it is the worst parental spying app I have come across. The installation is a headache, there are as such no regular updates and you have to call them whenever you face any problem. I will never recommend it to anyone. Dear Angela, thank you for your feedback! We are constantly improving our software and striving to make the installation process as painless as possible. The Customer Support team works around the clock to help our clients install and set up the mSpy app. Feel free to contact them in case of any further issues. I have recently to using mSpy on my desktop. But I’m not able to play any of the recorded sounds or videos. I tried contacting the expert team but it wasn’t helpful. Mspy has been a wastage of money for me☹. I started using mspy last year and since then I’m very happy with this app. It helps me monitor my kid’s social activities without letting them know and if I find any difficulty I can easily contact customer support who are very helping. I will recommend this app to all my friends who are having issues with their children. The Customer Support team is thrilled to hear such good feedback! Thank you, Freddy does this app work with 2 factor authentication? Hello, Jen! Unfortunately, you need to disable the 2-fa for the app to work properly. How can I track target device without Apple ID & Password? HI M REQUESTING FOR ASSISTANCE ON UR HELP OPTION SINCE A HOUR BUT NO RESPONSE Hello, Suresh! Did our support agent get back to you? Mspy isn’t all that it makes itself out to be. Yes it can do all the features it advises. But the signal in which targets device receives depends on the correct data being retrieved. GPS wont always be correct even with good connection to Internet.. If target has hidden apps to text or talk email etc. It doesn’t show it on keylogger and or installed apps. You can block websites & wifi & apps & numbers yet my target was able to access them anyways . When blocked just a few apps ( duo, facebook , etc. ) Targets device went haywire which alerts something is wrong and each time to get updated there device I get kicked off and have to reinstall it again. To view gmail facebook snapchat instagram skye etc you have to root targets device or you see nothing. Now these items mentioned are things I would have liked to have had accurately and directly. Otherwise what they offer is correct and it will be worth your time to try it out. I’m a second time subscriber & in 30 days will continue my contract. Hello, Julie! Thank you for choosing to continue using mSpy. We’re sorry that you have encountered some troubles with the app. New OS updates can interfere with some features but we are trying our best to keep up with the releases and come up with new solutions that are compatible with the OS. We are currently releasing a new update of the app where we fixed some of the issues you’ve mentioned. We’re also adding a new feature – Screenrecorder – so check it out once it is available 🙂 Can this app recover deleted sms texts, Facebook messages & Instagram messages? If so, how far back can be recovered? Hello, Monica! Old deleted messages can be recovered only if they were previously backed up on the phone and the app can access the back up. Otherwise, you will only be able to view messages that start coming after the installation of the app. If mSpy manages to extract the data before a message or a call is deleted, you will still be able to view it in your Control Panel even if it’s no longer available on the device itself. If the target phone has a security code to access its use can massistance be used to do the application download remotely? I can NOT get the app to work on my daughter iPhone 11. I paid for additional help and they said iphone is too hard to install on because of its heavy security. I have been wasting Days trying to get it to work. I even did factory reset on phone. will be asking for a refund. Hello, Kim! We’re sorry for not providing the help you were looking for. It’s true that it became somewhat troublesome to get the app installed on iPhones after the latest iOS update. But our team is actively working on developing new solutions to go around the restrictions, so please be on the lookout for future mSpy releases. How long does it take to sync the backup after I first install mspy? Hello, Alexis! Usually, it takes up to 24 hours to transfer all backed up data to your Control Panel. I’m just checking to verify, but using mspy premium on an iPhone doesnt let you see things like Snapchat or Tinder, correct? Hello, James! Yes, unfortunately, only iMessage and WhatsApp tracking are available for iPhones right now. Our team is working on adding more social apps, so be on the lookout for that 🙂 Hi, Is there an mspy product for iOS 14+ with two-factor authentication (cannot be disabled) that can monitor FB Messenger? I have physical access to the target device and login credentials, etc. Hello, Craig! Please contact our support via chat or email, they will help you find the most suitable solution for your device. Tell me everything it does. can it block bad content and make the phone safe is there away around it the kids can find Hi, Mia! Yes, there are blocking features available. You can block apps that you don’t want your kids to use as well as websites and Wi-Fi networks. You can check out our demo to see what the app offers. As for the second question, it’s hard to locate mSpy on the device and remove it. You can also choose to hide all app icons from the user when installing the app. Hi. I want to be sure we will see Facebook and Whatsapp messages on an iphone 8 no jailbreak. Hello, Annie! Unfortunately, due to recent security updates from Apple, only WhatsApp monitoring is available for iPhones right now. We’re working on adding back other messengers so more apps will be available for monitoring soon. We paid for this because mspy states that it works for Snapchat and Instagram and the other items that would be beneficial however, after installing it and talking with the help center they assured us that it only works on WhatsApp and 2 others that we have never even heard of. This has been no help at this point. We only got it for Snapchat and Instagram. So not sure why it advertises those when it’s not true. I’m feeling like this is a SCAM at this point. Can someone fix this or refund our money. Hello, Donna! Could you let me know whether your target device is an iPhone? If so, then yes, currently we support only WhatsApp tracking for iOS. Unfortunately, all other social apps are available only for Androids. But we’re working on adding more apps and various solutions for iPhone as well. If you need help, you can contact our support in the chat or email us at billing@mspy.com. I signed up for mspy service. The account was set up using anytrans. THree days later I cannot sign up anytrans with the mspy credentials, contacted customer service and was told to reach out to them again in ten hours as their technical support was busy. Contacted them 12 hours later and was told to contact them 5 hours later. Just a waste of time.I wish I haven’t relied on their services – With this customer service even if the product is good, which I don’t know since I was unable to use it, it’s not worth the headache. I want to see how long is going to take for the refund! Hello, Ale! We’re really sorry for the delay with the feedback, there are a lot of user requests coming our way and we’re trying our best to get back to everyone. Is the email you specified here the same one you used to sign up for mSpy? I’ll ping the support team and pass them your comment. Where can I find the actual app to download so I don’t have to constantly log in online to see my info ? Hi, Mo! Currently, there’s no app version for mSpy, sorry. Hello, can mspy track sent and received messages on Signal messaging app on Android? Hello, Praveen! Unfortunately, mSpy doesn’t support Signal monitoring right now.

It is a monitoring tool that allows you to know what they are doing on their devices. Although the focus is on parental control, mSpy can be used in many other situations. mSpy comes with a treasure trove of tools and features that will help you keep your child as safe as possible on the internet. There are so many tools and options that if you’d rather not be too invasive, you can do that. But if you absolutely have to know all the nitty-gritty details of your child’s interactions with their friends, you can do that too. If you need a little additional assistance with keeping track of your kids and their technology use, mSpy is a robust app with additional monitoring options, which allow parents to see who their kids call, what they text, and their GPS location among other activities. For seriously hard-core tracking, the mSpy software app will “run in an invisible mode providing you with across-the-board logging features so that you can remotely track all activity that takes place on the monitored phone. mSpy has been one of the most top rated cell phone monitoring services currently available. It is indeed a one-stop solution to track and monitor the messages received and sent on a smartphone belonging to your kids and employees. mSpy is the lead parental app on the market with over 25 features for children monitoring will assist you to know which sites your children visit, photos and videos they send on the major social media and know where exactly they are at every point in time in this busy world we live in. mSpy, one of the leaders in the industry. Software like mSpy will let you monitor the most popular social networks, input a \"forbidden\" location you don't want your child to visit and get an alarm if the app tracked the device in that area, and set limits for when they can use the internet and remotely block the device if needed. mSpy is one of the best parental control apps that is available on the market. With over 1.000.000 users worldwide it continuously provides high both quality product and service. Mobile Spy (mSpy) is the world’s most popular cell phone for a reason: it accesses a massive amount of information from a targeted smartphone or tablet. The system can monitor text messages, apps, emails, contacts, and pinpoint the phone’s location. You can also restrict access to certain websites and apps. Teaching your children to use the internet is almost like teaching them to cycle. When I discussed this issue with the executives of parental control software mSpy, they were very clear about what kind of surveillance is okay and what is not. Informing your child that they are being monitored for their own safety and that it will stop once they have learned to use the internet well is okay. A recent experiment shows the potential dangers of Snapchat. In a recent social media experiment by video blogger Coby Persin, a 14-year-old girl named Sasha was lured into a face-to-face meeting with an adult man via the social media platform Snapchat.

It tracks everything from the location of the device to text messages and other media shared across all the apps that the person is using.  In addition to that, this mobile phone tracking app comes with a Control Panel, which allows you to monitor the device of interest from any web browser. The best part of using mSpy software is that it runs totally undetected, and the other person will never know there is a spying app on their device.   mSpy has a very simple mode of action. All you need to do is to install this mobile phone tracker on the target device, and you are ready to go.  You can select from a variety of features that you would like to track. Then, you need to log in to your personal dashboard called Control Panel to keep an eye on every change that has taken place on the device.   Yes, you can use the mSpy phone tracker in the UK. The procedure of purchasing and installing the app in the UK is the same as in any other country.  Create a free mSpy account, install the app on the target device, and start tracking right away via the Control Panel.   mSpy is a tried and tested phone tracking app. You can make sure that it is not a scam in several ways. First, look for reviews from other customers, and you’re likely to find that our clients tend to share good feedback and testimonials only. Secondly, you should know that we’ve been operating since 2010 and have received numerous positive reviews from experts in the field of tracking software.  Finally, you can always begin with an unpaid trial period to see for yourself why so many people cannot imagine their lives without mSpy. In addition to that, if you ever face any problems using this app, you can always get professional support from the care team at mSpy.   No, you only need to install the mSpy phone tracker app on the target device. You will get access to the data gathered from the other person’s device via the online dashboard. In short, all you need is a stable internet connection and web browser to use mSpy.   mSpy GPS phone tracker is designed around convenience and ease of use. You will need around 10 minutes to get started with the app. Just sign up, make the payment, and install the mSpy mobile phone tracking app in compliance with the instructions sent to you by email.  Once everything is done, you can use your mSpy credentials to log in to the Control Panel and start tracking.   No, they will have no idea that they have a mobile phone tracking app installed on their device. mSpy makes that possible by running under the radar on the target smartphone since the app doesn’t slow it down or drain the battery.   The mSpy phone tracker app updates the information from the target device every 5-30 minutes if you chose to monitor an Android. And if you track an iPhone, the data on your Control Panel will be updated every 24 hours.  You can also set it to alert you if a certain action is done. For instance, if the other user typed some trigger words or entered or left a specific area. Some things like the location of the target can also be set to be updated in real-time if you want.   You will have to physically access the target device once before you can start phone tracking with mSpy. The reason is that phone trackers cannot be installed on mobile devices remotely. However, once the app is up and running, you’ll never have to touch the target smartphone ever again.   Free phone tracking services do exist, but they are not advised. First of all, they do not offer many features. Secondly, they are not reliable, and there is a huge risk of a data leak. If you want the best phone tracker app, there is no better option than mSpy.

        "link": "https://xnspy.com/xnspy-vs-mspy.html",
        "desc": "MSpy comes with a neat online interface and some great features but, it's been a while since they have come up with something new. To look into this, we went through mSpy's year-old online reviews for any missing features that the app may have on its current version. Interestingly, it still was the same app a year ago.",
        "body": "JUST IN: The all-new Screen Recorder for Android. Learn more.  Introducing all new Android Screen Recorder  Xnspy and mSpy are the two most commonly used spying apps on the internet. They both offer various interesting cell phone spying features, making it hard for the potential users to choose one. While Xnspy is famous for its advanced features, mSpy is also famous for its parental controls. But, the question is: Who gets to be the no. 1 spy app? In order to know the answer, continue reading this our very in-depth comparison review article. Our assessment is based on four different factors: Features, performance, pricing, and compatibility. Exploring and comparing the features of the two spy apps helps in identifying the diversity of features that are being offered. Both have similar basic features such as call logs and text messages monitoring but they are versatile in their advanced features. A host of online resources can also be referenced for a more conclusive feature’s comparison of Xnspy. Here is a detailed features comparison of Xnspy and mSpy for both Android and iOS devices. To use Xnspy on an Android device, you need two things: Here are some advanced features that are offered with the premium edition of Xnspy for Android devices along with the basic features. Xnspy is offering services for both jailbreak and non-jailbroken iOS devices. To use Xnspy on an iOS device, all you need is: Along with the above-mentioned features, Xnspy offers some additional basic features for jailbroken devices. These features are given below: Here are some advanced features that are offered with the premium edition of Xnspy for iOS devices with no jailbreak. All the above-mentioned features are also offered for jailbroken iOS devices. However, Xnspy offers some additional features for a jailbroken iOS device mentioned below: mSpy also requires physical access to the device for installation. Instant messages work on rooted Android devices only. There are few features that are available for the no jailbroken iOS devices. These features are given below: Along with the aforementioned features, some additional features are offered for jailbroken iOS devices: Some advanced features are also offered for iOS jailbroken devices. Both apps are offering somehow similar basic features. The advanced features create a difference for the customers. Both spy apps offer social media monitoring but mSpy takes the lead as it can monitor a few more messaging apps like Snapchat, Hangouts, and Telegram. The remote access features of Xnspy is extraordinary, including the ambient recording, remote phone data wiping, and remotely taking screenshots. Both applications have a Keylogger feature. Only Xnspy can record social media keystrokes, too. Watchlist alert features also differentiate two spy apps as Xnspy offers more instant alerts than mSpy. Xnspy beats mSpy by offering more advanced features. Hopefully, this comparison table helps you to compare the features of Xnspy and mSpy! The performance of Xnspy can be analyzed through rating and reviews published on other expert review websites. Here is the verdict of a popular app reviewing website, Top Ten Reviews.com about Xnspy: “XNSPY is a good choice for monitoring your child’s phone and internet activity. However, you should look elsewhere if you want to control when and how long they can use their device.” This is what another app reviewing website, PCMAG.com has to say: “When you think of parental control apps, you probably picture keeping youngsters away from nasty websites and controlling how much time they spend online. Most of these apps also generate activity reports for parents, and many offer real-time notification of any abuses. Xnspy (for iPhone) doesn't try to control what your child does. It sticks to monitoring the child's activity undetectably. If spying on your kids suits you, and you don't need real-time reporting, Xnspy could be what you need.” Xnspy has thousands of customers. According to SiteJabber, Xnspy is the best spy app available in the market with an average rating of 3.6 out of 5. This is what the customers have to say about Xnspy: “No lies or fake promises-It's feels great to finally have a decent spyware app that's free of BS. Great work, team Xnspy! I have wasted enough money already on these apps and I was going to go very nasty in my review if this app hadn't worked either. But, that didn't happen and I am very happy!” – Stephen W “I love this new culture of transparency at my firm that came along with the installation of Xnspy on all of the company-provided smartphones. Now I know exactly what my employees do on their cell phones during work hours.” – Alex Carpenter Here is the verdict of app reviewing website, Top Ten Reviews.com about mSpy: “mSpy is an effective monitoring program that works on both computers and mobile devices, plus gives you detailed insights into your child’s online activity. However, it is expensive.” mSpy has a large number of customers but going through the evaluations of these customers on the top rated websites, I have mentioned reviews of a few unsatisfied customers below: “Poor Product, Non-existent customer service: Purchased the app in an attempt to track Snapchat on an iPhone of one of out children. After purchasing was told that Snapchat was not available - could only track text messages and browser history. Requested a refund 1 day after purchasing and the company has refused to refund, claiming their website disclosed this. Unless your looking to only track texts and internet, I would absolutely steer clear. Customer service is non-existent.\" – Tony Keeler “Worst tech Support: Does not work well with iPhone (not jailbroken). Customer support is the worst, and just gives you the run around (ask you to remove and re-install device, then wait for hours for data that doesn't show; then, next chat person tells you to do the same). After 3 days of doing this, now I cannot login, cannot chat (my id and IP address have been blocked). Called number on site, and person just hung up on me before I could even ask for tech support number. Definitely do not recommend!!!!” – Mauro M Performance is one of the key factors that help in making a decision in comparing the two apps. It is clear that mSpy has a large number of customers but the fact isn’t ignorable that Xnspy being relatively new in the spying app market has gained more popularity. The basic reason behind this rising fame is the high rate of satisfaction among the customers. Most of the app rating sites have criticized mSpy for being unreasonably overpriced as compared to the offered features. The rating and comments of the customers on the famous reviewing sites also show that Xnspy is doing much better as compared to mSpy. The customers appreciate the performance of Xnspy offering all the promised features as well as providing customer support service. Whenever you need to buy a spyware program, either for Android or iOS, pricing is one of the essential factors you should be looking at. Who doesn’t want to get the best stuff at the best rates? There are spying apps that are even charging over $100 for only a month’s subscription. Xnspy is offering its finest service at a quite reasonable price. Though you may say that Xnspy isn’t the cheapest app available in the spying app market but, it’s offering the best deal for the long-term users. You can get the most suitable pricing package if you want to use it for more than a few months. Xnspy is offering two pricing packages for Android OS and iOS: Basic and Premium. These two editions differ in prices based on the features they offer. If you want to get a monthly subscription, you will be charged $35.99 per month. If you want to get a quarterly subscription, you will be charged $59.99 quarterly implying that you will be billed $19.99 per month. If you want to get a yearly subscription, you will be charged $89.99 annually implying that you will be billed $7.49 per month. If you want to get a monthly subscription for basic edition, you will be charged $29.99 per month. If you want to get a quarterly subscription, you will be charged $41.99 quarterly implying that you will be billed $13.99 per month. If you want to get a yearly subscription, you will be charged $59.99 annually implying that you will be billed $4.99 per month. mSpy is offering its services at a relatively high price. mSpy is offering two pricing packages for its users: Basic and Premium. If you want to get a monthly subscription, you will be charged $69.99 per month. If you want to get a quarterly subscription, you will be charged $119.99 quarterly implying that you will be billed $39.99 per month. If you want to get a yearly subscription, you will be charged $199.99 annually implying that you will be billed $16.66 per month. For the Basic edition, mSpy is offering only a monthly package. If you want to get a monthly subscription, you will be charged $29.99 per month for both Android and iOS. Here is a summary table for you to compare the prices of the two most commonly used spying apps. You can observe that Xnspy is offering more features with a premium subscription for both Android and iOS users at a relatively lower price than mSpy. So, Xnspy seems to be comparatively cheaper than mSpy for the customers. Before buying a spying app, It’s important to check whether the device you want to monitor is compatible with the selected spying app or not. Currently, Xnspy works on all Android OS devices that are running between OS 4.0 to OS 10.0 Xnspy works on all iOS devices like iPhones, iPads, and iPods with Jailbreak that is running between iOS 6.0 to iOS 9.0.2, and all iOS devices without Jailbreak that is running between iOS 6.0 to iOS 15.1 For operational use, mSpy requires that the target device including smartphones and tablets must be running from Android OS 4.0 and above. mSpy with Jailbreak version is compatible with iOS 7.0 to 8.4 and 9.0 to 9.1 only and with all iOS versions without jailbreak. Both Xnspy and mSpy have held the top two spots interchangeably for too long. But guess it’s time to declare one absolute winner once and for all. MSpy comes with a neat online interface and some great features but, it’s been a while since they have come up with something new. To look into this, we went through mSpy’s year-old online reviews for any missing features that the app may have on its current version. Interestingly, it still was the same app a year ago. Xnspy, however, has introduced a couple of good features just alone in the year 2018-19. For instance, the aforementioned Call Time Activity Punch Card, Top 5 Callers, Top 5 Call Durations, Top 10 Most Frequently Visited Websites, all of these reporting features were added recently to bring in a more efficient spying experience where users won’t have to sift through immense amounts of data that are being saved on a monitored device on an everyday basis. Apart from the features and upgrades, Xnspy is also priced lowest in spyware programs industry. The prices are unbeatable and definitely worth every penny of yours. We also loved the 24/7 customer support on Xnspy as they do everything within their capacity to help you out. We do think that mSpy is a great app but Xnspy certainly has more tricks up its sleeves and hence deserves the number 1 spot on the list of best mobile spyware programs. Limited Time Offer XNSPY SOFTWARE IS INTENDED FOR LEGAL USE ONLY. XNSPY is a smartphone and tablet monitoring software designed for parents who wish to monitor their children under 18 years and employers who want to keep track of their employees through company-owned smartphones and tablets.

        "body": "#1 Monitoring Software – 100% hidden and effective Table of Contents mSpy is one of the most popular and well-known mobile phone spy programs available on the market today. Since its launch in 2010, mSpy’s staff has really worked hard on the product and made it the market leader for a period of time. Most of it is due to its comprehensive service and user-friendly design. You can use mSpy as a security app for a device you own, as an effective tool to monitor children’s online activities, or even control your employees. Once mSpy has been installed on the target device, you can monitor almost all the activities on that device. For example, you can constantly stay on top of instant messages, text messages, GPS locations, videos, photos, browsing history, phone calls, emails, and more on that device. In addition, you can consult all these activities from anywhere in the world. After installation, mSpy works in stealth mode, in the background on the target device, silently recording each and every one of the activities performed on it and sending all that information to the associated mSpy account. From then on, this account can be accessed online, allowing you to review the records, from anywhere and whenever you want. View Demo mSpy can be purchased in the form of two different versions on its official website – Basic Version and Premium Version. As expected, the Premium Version is called that because it offers more features. Below, we will illustrate more clearly the difference between these two versions and their corresponding characteristics. Below is a quick summary (mSpy Reviews) of all the main features that mSpy Premium offers. This mSpy function allows you to record and upload all the GPS location data of the target device. This implies that you can be constantly updated on the whereabouts of the target device, at all hours. It is an amazing feature for concerned employers and parents. Every email received and sent from the target mobile phone is recorded and uploaded to the mSpy server. This feature helps you monitor all email activity that occurs on the target device, covering multiple clients, including Gmail. mSpy keeps a comprehensive record of every phone call made and received on the destination device. Recorded information includes contact names, phone numbers, and corresponding call durations, times, and dates. The software records the details as well as the content of each text message received and sent from the destination device. Note that this information is obtained even if the messages have been removed from the target device. mSpy helps you collect details about the Wi-Fi connections the target device connects to, and even gives you the ability to manage those connections. It also has the ability to view all the videos and photos stored on the target device. Using this mSpy function, you can learn about each keystroke typed on the target device. All keystrokes are constantly recorded and uploaded to the mSpy server. This recording is possible for all Android mobile devices and iPhones. mSpy users also have the ability to lock the target device or even wipe it completely from a remote location, in case the device has been stolen or lost. mSpy allows you to view all contact details on the target device, as well as monitor every calendar activity on it. This information can be very useful for corporate users, as they can stay up-to-date on their employees’ schedules and meetings. With most of the online interactions occurring in instant messaging systems today, this feature has proven to be extremely useful to all mSpy users. By using it, you can constantly record and monitor the messages received and sent from the destination device, through instant messaging services. The instant messaging apps covered by this feature include WhatsApp, Viber, Google Hangouts, Skype, Snapchat, LINE, Tinder, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, and iMessage. Please note that although mSpy can only be used on one device at a time, it is always possible to change the target device as many times as you like. You can even monitor the target device based on specific keywords and receive notifications every time the target user has entered a specific keyword. This keyword alert can be applied to all the media used on that device. Interested parents can block incoming calls from specific phone numbers, to keep their children away from danger. This can be accomplished through the device management tab in the mSpy Control Panel. You can also block target user access to certain websites or applications that you consider potentially harmful. Again, this is a very useful feature for concerned parents who don’t want their children to visit inappropriate websites or use dangerous apps. As also previously highlighted, as soon as mSpy is installed on the target device, it runs in completely invisible and stealth mode, in the background. The target user will never receive even a small hint that he is being monitored. The mSpy software keeps a complete record of every Internet activity that occurs on the target device, covering search histories, bookmarks, and web histories. You will receive an instant update every time the target phone user changes their SIM card. By using this mSpy feature, you can create a virtual area and receive instant notifications every time the target device is taken out of that default border. View Demo Although the premium version of mSpy offers all the features detailed above, the basic package is missing some. The basic version of mSpy for mobile devices does not have the functions listed below: Previously, mSpy used to be available only for jailbroken iPhone, but now the software can work even on non-jailbroken iPhone devices. However, not all features have made it to this version, due to certain technical limitations. The mSpy non-jailbroken version has all the usual features except: Since there are different versions of mSpy for different devices, and not all devices are compatible, it is very important to check if the device you want to monitor is compatible with mSpy software or not. To install mSpy on the target device, you must meet the following criteria: Before going into the mSpy installation details, it is important to note that although you can remotely access and manage all of the mSpy features on the target device, you will need physical access at least once to install the mSpy software. The mSpy installation process is quite simple. You can have the monitoring software running simply by following the 3 steps outlined below: Step 1. Select the mSpy subscription. The first step in the process is to visit the mSpy website and buy a subscription that meets your needs. Step 2. Access to the Control Panel. After your payment is processed, you will receive a confirmation email from mSpy, consisting of a link that will take you to the mSpy Control Panel. This is the area where you will be presented with all the information collected from the target device. Step 3. Installing the mSpy software. Once you reach the Control Panel area for the first time, you will be provided with simple instructions to help you install the mSpy software on the target device. You should follow these simple instructions to download and install the mSpy software on the target device. After it is installed, the downloaded file will be automatically removed and mSpy will start monitoring the target device in the background, in stealth mode. View Demo >> Once you’re done with these 3 steps, mSpy is ready to go! The cost of the mSpy subscription will depend entirely on the package you choose. The following are the different packages available, along with their prices: Please note that all mSpy subscriptions come with a full 10-day money back guarantee, allowing you to try the product without risking anything. View Demo Please note that mSpy is a professional monitoring product that has been specifically designed for interested employers and parents to help them monitor the activities of their employees and children, respectively, on the devices they own. You are legally within your rights to use mSpy as long as you comply with this. On the other hand, it is illegal to use any type of spyware on devices that you do not own or that you do not have explicit permission to monitor. It will be only if you choose to use mSpy in this way. The developers of the mSpy software claim that it is completely undetectable once it has been installed on the target device, implying that it can monitor all activities on the target device without its user knowing. We were not quite sure of the veracity of this claim, therefore we did our best to test it thoroughly. We must say that we were surprised by the results! Once installed on the target device, the mSpy software leaves no evidence of its presence. We even searched the settings of the target device, but couldn’t find anything. This implies that even if the person you are monitoring suspects that they are being monitored, they cannot prove in any way unless, of course, they let you know. View Demo One of the common gifts of this hidden software is that it depletes the device battery fairly quickly. Once the user begins to notice that the battery life is no longer the same, they begin to suspect that something is happening. Although it is true that mSpy consumes a certain amount of battery, its effects are too minimal to be noticed. This has been proven on both old and new devices and no one can tell the difference, particularly for frequently used mobile devices. One of the outstanding qualities of mSpy is that the software is backed by excellent customer support. Their website features extremely responsive and helpful live chat support, plus a comprehensive FAQ section that contains almost all the information you may need about the product. However, you can also take advantage of a couple of paid and specialized support services if you’re not too tech-oriented and need help during the installation process. These support services are: mAssistance – Specifically provided to assist you with jailbreaking or rooting the target device, followed by installation support, mAssistance is an amazing support feature that involves TeamViewer and many other additional customer support tools. Requires a one-time payment of $43.99 Telephone Support – At a reasonable charge of $12.99, telephone support connects you to an experienced technician who can walk you through the entire installation process. mSpy really does an amazing job on mobile phones to really deserve a spot on our list. Its wide range of features, ease of use, and ease of installation set it apart from other similar products. You can implement it on almost any mobile device running any known operating system. The Control Panel is easy to use, well designed and presents detailed information in a very organized way. It is a mandatory stop for all interested parents, employers and spouses who want comprehensive monitoring without risk. View Demo Save"

Consumers satisfied with mSpy most frequently mention social media, technical support and great job. mSpy ranks 8th among Mobile Applications sites.  This company responds to reviews on average within 27 days Let me tell you that: this app is fa-bu-lous! My teenage daughter just got her driver's license and of Course she wants to hang out with her friends driving around town. I was scared to death that something could happen and I was not able to help, so I installed mspy on her phone and use it as a GPS tracker. At least now I know where she is every single moment and if I feel much more relaxed. Thanks mspy! I don't find an option for the zero hence giving one star. I will not recommend it at all. I am an IT person and purchased a yearly plan (ID # 7404219) almost 7 months back but it never worked. MSpy does not bother about the usage that means they don't care if it works for you or not. Once you made the payment their job is done. I'm using iPhone 11 and 12 and it never worked for me. Please DO NOT WASTE your hard-earned money.

Dear Customer, Thank you for your review, all feedback is important to us and we’re sorry to hear you’ve had such a frustrating experience.

We would really appreciate it if you contact us via live chat or email address. As soon as you contact us back, we will do our best to assist you promptly and find the most compatible and suitable ways of monitoring your target device. Thank you for your understanding and patience! I made a purchase and it was advertised at their website that for iPhone doesn't need physical access for the target phone and can be accessed through any browser, but that was not true at all. After I made the purchase, mspy didn't work and I have been told I need physical access to the phone and I can only access through PC after downloading a software. I requested a refund which has been denied. Stay away from it as the will take your money and fulfill their obligations. Bad experience big time Dear Customer, We regret that the application was beyond your expectations. Our Billing Department did confirm that the refund has been successfully processed in your favor. In the meantime, the issue with iPhones monitoring has been already fixed by the development team. Please feel free to contact us for any further assistance. Kind regards, MSpy Team I purchased the product after speaking with customer service who told me that if this product did not work on my iPhone, then they would fully refund my money. I cancelled my service, and asked for a refund. They have not answered back. They send an email saying that they are working on it. Now, it's been over a month with no response at all. Do NOT get this product. They are a rip off! At this point, I am reporting them to the BBB as a scam. Dear Customer, We regret to hear about your experience. A partial refund has been issued by the billing department as you were informed by email back in July. In the meantime, the issue with Iphones monitoring has been already fixed by the development team. Kind regards, MSpy Team Over 50! Emails exchanged with the customer service I paid over $65 to receive! Never updated! No response to request for refund. Extremely Aggravating! Just save yourself A lot of time and money. Used them in past WO problem, it seems their service has expired beyond just collecting your money. Tip for consumers: Don't! Go AnyWhere Else.. Products used: Purchase mspy for apple iPhone for $119.99 Support for $53.99 Extra Support for $12.99 Dear Customer, Please accept our apologies due to the inconvenience caused by this problem. We would really appreciate if you provide us with your Customer ID or email address. As soon as we locate your account, we will do our best to assist you promptly and solve this issue. Thank you for your understanding and patience! They charged me for a year... Actually they double charged me and it wasn't easy to get a refund for the duplicate charge. The service sucks to begin with then it stopped working completely after a couple of months... Blank white screen. I'm done, don't want the subscription anymore and they say they can't give me a refund. They only email, you can't talk to a person and each email takes 3-4 days. I'd give a negative review if I could. Dear Customer, I’m sorry to hear about your disappointment with us and I would like to personally assist you with making things right. Please provide me with your customer ID so that we can check it further and offer an alternative for you. Thank you for your understanding and patience! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Originally had issues even accessing the site. The was down, requested refund and to close this account as basic functions not working and is unacceptable. Gave me a complete lack of confidence in the product. Sent in request and they refused to refund because they cancelled the account first instead of telling me I need to accept tech help before giving refund. Definitely bad business practice and bad customer service over all. * mSpy attempted to help this customer through the Sitejabber Resolution Center, but the customer did not respond The amount of help from the company coupled with the average response time via email being 9-14 days on average is terrible. The features promised are not available. I paid for 3 months in advance, ask to cancel with a refund within days due to lack of promised features only to be told all they can offer is to chat with me about install. There are no customer service numbers, no guarantees, no help whatsoever. They wouldn't even refund the remaining two months. Stay away, any other service has to be better than this. Tip for consumers: Just don’t, trust me please. Dear Customer, Please accept our apologies due to the inconvenience caused by this problem. We would really appreciate if you provide us with your Customer ID or email address. As soon as we locate your account, we will do our best to assist you promptly and solve this issue. Thank you for your understanding and patience! App never tracks anything. At first they refused to refund me my money and when they finally did, I get didn't get the full amount back. Big scam. Stay away from this app. I got my self an hacker I searched through Google who helped me with what I wanted. I'll recommend him instead Hackrakesh on insta gram. Tip for consumers: Do not use Mspy, all they advertise is a lie. Products used: Hackrakesh on instagram Dear Customer, I’m sorry to hear about your disappointment with us and I would like to personally assist you with making things right. We respect your decision to apply for reimbursement, we cannot proceed with your refund without knowing the exact reason. We would kindly ask you to specify your issue in detail and we would really happy to solve it as soon as possible. Thank you for your understanding and patience! After paying the subscription fee, I realized that this won't work for me. Immediately I sent them a message to ask for a refund and these scams never did. They want 7 days to pass so that they will reply and say 7 days has passed and we cannot refund you. I hate these scams because they too fast when it comes to taking money from our accounts but they will not follow on the emails you sending them after that. I will only remove my review after getting my refund. Tip for consumers: People beware, mspy is too fast when it's comes to taking money from your bank account. They always ready and up for your money but customer service you won't get because they are too busy and they will reply after ... Business days. Which is the blue because they only care about your money and not about you. Subscribe at your own risk, they will show you flames these cruel scams. Products used: I didn't use nothing from these scams Dear Customer, thank you for choosing mSpy! Please accept our sincere apologies for these temporary inconveniences. Please provide me with your customer ID so that i can check it further and offer an alternative for you. Looking forward to hearing from you. DO NOT BUY! Despite chats with their customer service and sending the exact make and model of the phone only after purchase they admitted it could not be rooted although that was my first question! Now I am still being refused a refund despite requesting it 10 days after purchase in February 2020 having never installed the software! DO NOT TRUST THEM! A company that refused to refund such small amount simply CANNOT BE TRUSTED! Happy to send proof of purchase and copies of emails and chats.

Please be informed that all the terms and conditions are described on our website along with the technical requirements for successful usage of our product. Our Customer Care is available 24/7 to assist you with any challenges that you may experience when setting up or using our product. We kindly ask you to reconsider our suggestion from the previous correspondence with our Billing Department. Kind regards, MSpy Team I had to speak with 8 individuals over the course of two months, continually asking since day 2 for a full refund. They gave me a hard time and sent me in circles, & they charge money to speak to someone on the phone. After finally approving my refund, there is a 9% fee for some BS bank processing. They display false advertising saying a non-jail broken iPhone can have SMS text and browser history viewed, calls, etc., but it can't. They literally make money off of their 9% fee after cancelling for getting people to sign up when they can't do what they say they can. It took me pressuring to get my lawyer involved for them to even acknowledge my refund. As someone who has spent decades in sales and customer service, this company is TERRIBLE. Stay away! Tip for consumers: Just don’t. Dear Customer, Thank you for your review, all feedback is important to us and we are sorry to hear that you have had such a frustrating experience. We would like to resolve this issue as quickly as possible and find a solution that works for you. Currently, we have several ways to monitor an iPhone. We would be very grateful if you could provide us with your customer number or email address. As soon as we locate your account, we'll do our best to help you quickly and find the most compatible and appropriate ways to monitor your target device. Thank you for your understanding and your patience! Thi company charged me 2 times bad experience for me. No telephone number they don't reply to email I'm so pis off. * mSpy attempted to help this customer through the Sitejabber Resolution Center, but the customer did not respond Dear Customer, thank you for choosing mSpy! Please accept our sincere apologies for these temporary inconveniences. Please provide me with your customer ID so that i can check it further and offer an alternative for you. Looking forward to hearing from you. Let me tell you that: this app is fa-bu-lous! My teenage daughter just got her driver's license and of Course she wants to hang out with her friends driving around town. I was scared to death that something could happen and I was not able to help, so I installed mspy on her phone and use it as a GPS tracker. At least now I know where she is every single moment and if I feel much more relaxed. Thanks mspy! I'd give ZERO stars if it were an option. They are terrible. I paid full price to use on my daughter's iPhone and can't use half of the services. On top of that, they've had technical issues with breaking thru on iPhones for the past MONTH and I can't get a refund at all. No one responds quickly enough and they kept trying to extend my 1 year purchase instead of refunding. I do NOT endorse this company. Waste of money and they do NOT advise upfront the lack of service you get on iPhones compared to Android. I am furious and will not stop pestering them until I have my refund. BEWARE! Dear Customer, We regret that the application was beyond your expectations. Our Billing Department did confirm that the full refund has been successfully processed in your favor. In the meantime, the issue with Iphones monitoring has been already fixed by the development team. All refunds are processed by our billing processor and once the refund is issued you will receive a corresponding notification with the necessary details. Kind regards, MSpy Team I did not see the $199 at the bottom until check out very misleading $12.99 month advertisement and they didn't put the $199 below it i asked for a refund never used service same day stated NO BOW THEY SAYING my issue is still be processed they are misleading an taking hard working people money during these hard times it's ridiculous Tip for consumers: Do not purchase Products used: Misleading * mSpy attempted to help this customer through the Sitejabber Resolution Center, but the customer did not respond Dear Customer, We regret to hear about your experience. Please check the latest correspondence with our Billing department to resolve your issue as soonest. If you have any other questions please let us know. Thank you, MSpy Team The billing team contact me to advise they wont refund because the software is working. This software has now failed again saying again data connection lost - for the second time after I have reinstalled. This is unacceptable! Every excuse under the sun not to refund! ------ Finally received a partial refund. Tip for consumers: Do not purchase! Products used: Mspy tracking app Dear Customer, Please accept our apologies due to the inconvenience caused by this problem. With this letter we confirm that the partial refund has been successfully processed in your favor. If you have any questions, please contact us. Kind Regards, I was informed my device should be alright to monitor snapchat otherwise i can request a refund. I purchased the 1 year and tried everything as per requested by mspy team but nothing worked and the answer was that I cant monitor snapchat on iso. I requested a refund so many times but they wont refund me and ask me to read their policy. I was traped from them. They are hopeless! Do Not Buy mspy! Products used: Mspy Dear Customer, We’re sorry your experience didn’t match your expectations Please note that your case is non-refundable according to the mSpy policy, we suggest a partial refund — 30% of the amount paid. At the same time, you will have an opportunity to continue using the software within your subscription plan for monitoring another target device during the billing period. Please let us know if this offer is suitable, and we will proceed with a partial refund. Looking forward to hearing from you. This company doesn't deserve one star they are that horrible. You have to pay before they even give you instructions on how to operate the app. When you try to chat with customer service they don't help you except direct you to some bogus site. I bought it tried to figure how to set it up and 2 hours later cancelled just to find out 11 days later they won't refund me. DON'T BUY INTO THESE CROOKS! * mSpy attempted to help this customer through the Sitejabber Resolution Center, but the customer did not respond Dear Customer, We regret to hear about your experience. Please check the latest correspondence with our Billing department to resolve your issue as soonest. If you have any other questions please let us know. Thank you, MSpy Team Dan Armstrong was very helpful each time I needed technical support. The app has a few quirks but overall very good. Software is a total rip-off. I was worried that it would not work on the target device, so I asked the support agent on their page if it would. He promised me it would work fine so I bought the premium service. Turns out it doesn't work on the device at all. And still, after blatantly lying to me and even admitting in a support ticket that it doesn't work as advertised they won't refund me! Don't buy this piece of crap! Tip for consumers: Don't buy this! Dear Customer, We regret to hear about your experience. Please provide your customer information so we can identify your account and provide an efficient solution as soon as possible. Thank you, MSpy Team I am very happy with mspy software srvices, and this is the reason. I have to start off by saying that this app is awesome. I didn't know products like this existed until a friend told me about it and I am very thankful they did. It allows me to track my employee's phones to make sure they are using our company phones for business purposes only. It grants me access to emails, text messages and calls, among many other things. This product is definitely a life and money saver! The service does not work at all on iOS. They will only take your money and make you wait on a fix while suspending service. They will make you wait several days to hear from the sales department about a possible refund. I wish I would have read reviews about the service before I purchased. They say it's compatible with iOS and no jailbreak but this is not true at all. BUYER Beware! Tip for consumers: Zero Stars until I receive a full refund for false claims of services they can provide. This is basically a SCAM having to wait several business days on a possible refund! Do not purchase MSpy! Products used: Mspy Premium Dear Customer, We are sorry to hear that at the moment you cannot use the product the way you want it to be used. Currently, we have several ways to monitor an iPhone.We recommend you to visit our live chat and our technical support representative will walk you through the process, which will take only 10-15 minutes of your time. In a live chat simply ask to try out the new solution for iPhones and you will be guided further. Thank you for your understanding and patience! I'm not sure where the positive reviews are coming from but I would not trust this company. I have been trying to ascertain a refund for the best part of 3 weeks and I started well within their 14 day refund policy. The company has stayed quiet, not really responding to any of my emails. Don't by into the idea that the pandemic is whats causing delays, as they were VERY RESPONSIVE when trying to secure payment Not Recommended! Tip for consumers: don't buy the product Products used: none Dear Customer, We are sorry for the inconveniences that you might have faced and we would like to offer you several solutions. The email with these options has been already sent to you. Please let us know if any of these options is suitable for you and we will assist you promptly. We are available 24/7. I did the purchase and when checking my bank account this company has charged a different amount twice, immediately I tried to make a communication whit them by email and the live chat but never received a response just received an automatic email and when intend writing on the live chat I received an answer that the system at the moment is close. It is very frustrating because they have announced a services 24/7 that it is false * mSpy attempted to help this customer through the Sitejabber Resolution Center, but the customer did not respond Dear Customer, I’m sorry to hear about your disappointment with us and I would like to personally assist you with making things right. Please provide me with your customer ID so that we can check it further and offer an alternative for you. Thank you for your understanding and patience! If I could leave minus stars I would. I spoke to the team online before purchasing this to protect my daughter and was promised I could see who she was messaging with her iCloud details and needing the phone for 5 minutes. However I followed the instructions and it doesn't show anything. I paid £74.99 for a year but was told I could request a refund if it didn't work. I have emailed them and so far been ignored. I really feel they have taken advantage of me and I can't afford to pay this kind of money for no service. - I will take this to trading standards Dear Customer, I understand your frustration and I am sorry that you feel this way. We would really appreciate if you provide us with your Customer ID or email address. As soon as we locate your account, we will do our best to assist you promptly and solve this issue. Thank you for your understanding and patience! Dear Julie, At the moment you can monitor Snapchat only on Android phones due to absence of jailbreak for the latest iOS versions.

Downloaded over 1 million times and going strong, Highster Mobile is still one of the best cell phone spy apps you can buy. Highster Mobile has been on the market since 2007. They helped pioneer the technology and remain the leader in cell phone spy applications.",
        "body": " “Can I spy on a cell phone without having it or without installing software to the phone I need to spy on?” That is the NUMBER ONE question I get. The answer is simple. Yes, you can! And it’s not nearly as hard as you may think. Hello, My name is Pat Sanderson and welcome to Safeguarde. I created this site around 8 years ago to help people like you solve the same problems I had. I suspected my wife of being unfaithful and I needed answers. There was a time that I would stop at nothing to put my mind at ease. After I found out the truth I was able to finally move on with my life and then decided to give back all that I had learned to help people who are in a similar situation. I made a list and reviewed what I have found to be the best spy apps for you to use. Each one is good in it’s own right. Choose the one that works best for you.   Excellent for all iPhones and Androids. No Access or Possession Needed.  Our TOP PICK! Auto Forward Spy was introduced in 2012 and has been a market leader ever since. Over the years, the app has been improved with remote access and the ability to monitor a phone without having it in your possession. They also have an option to “clone a phone” which shows you how to create an exact copy of one phone to another. Very cool! The latest version now lets you use their exclusive OTA (over-the-air) link to download the app to your phone where it creates a remote connection over the internet to the phone you want to spy on. All you have to do is download the app, activate it using your license key, then enter the number of the cell phone you want to spy on. You can be getting information from the other phone within minutes! Auto Forward delivers everything you need and then some. We tested a variety of iPhones and Androids and we did not encounter any issues. Auto Forward can extract text messages and iMessages (even if they have been deleted). The app also gathers calls, GPS, Facebook, Instagram and a lot more! Among its many benefits is its quick and easy download. Auto Forward Spy works by establishing a remote connection over the internet with the target phone (the phone that is being spied on). Using the OTA (over-the-air) link, you can remotely download the app and monitor the target phone without having it in your possession. Once a remote connection is established, Auto Forward continuously uploads activity from the target phone to your secure online account. You can literally monitor the target phone right from your own cell phone without being anywhere near it!      Read my Auto Forward Review Works with all Androids and iPhones.  Another app that allows you to spy on a cell phone without having it in your possession! That’s Highster Mobile in a nutshell. Great technology that’s easy to use for the average “Joe”. Downloaded over 1 million times and going strong, Highster Mobile is still one of the best cell phone spy apps you can buy. Highster Mobile has been on the market since 2007. They helped pioneer the technology and remain the leader in cell phone spy applications.

If you’re looking for a low-cost spy app for Android or iPhone, Highster Mobile should be at the top of your list. It’s competitively priced, offers many useful features, has a user-friendly web interface and it’s very easy to use, even for beginners.      Read my Highster Mobile Review  DDI Utilities is a next-generation utility program that can extract and deliver large amounts of data and activity from any cell phone quickly, easily and silently without having the phone anywhere near you. DDI is fast taking over space in the market once occupied by cell phone spy programs that just don’t work anymore. As new models and operating systems are introduced it has become more difficult to find a spy app that actually works. DDI Utilities works! DDI Utilities download procedure is simple. All you have to do is text the download link to the phone you want to monitor. When the link is activated (tapped on) the automatic install begins and within minutes stored data and activity from the phone uploads to your secure online account.

Visit their website: www.phonespector.com Read my Phonespector Review When looking for spy apps for phones, the question that always comes up is: Is it possible to spy on text messages without installing software on the target phone? While many think this impossible, I would urge you to think again and to read this article I found, and reposted, about a woman who’s estranged boyfriend was able to spy on her cell phone without having the phone. You’ll learn how to spy on someone’s phone remotely using the best phone spy apps.     Today two types of devices dominate the mobile market: Androids and iPhones. Through independent research, I have narrowed down the best cell spy software for both. While there are many reasons someone would need to spy on texts (if you are an employer or a parent for instance,) catching a cheating spouse is the most popular. Over the years, I have learned a lot (mostly I learned what not to do!) and what I have learned is that you need to find a text message spying app from a company that has three basic but very important features. They are: Now that we’ve covered the basics of what you want in a company, let’s talk about the Android and iPhone spy apps themselves. With the emergence of more powerful utility apps that are now being used to spy on cell phones, I have altered my top picks to better reflect the latest technology. Here they are:   So, how do you sort through the junk? Below, I’ve provided a list of the top five cell phone spyware apps available today (I have actually tested and used each one of them). Each of these will enable you to read someone’s text messages and just about all activity of virtually any mobile device. Read carefully and know that whichever of these you choose, you’ll gain peace of mind with your purchase. IMPORTANT: Each of the programs below is capable of retrieving more than just text messages from a cell phone or tablet. They will retrieve phone activities such as; Calls, GPS location, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, websites visited, photos, videos and much more. These programs are very powerful and will enable you to spy on a mobile device much like any government or private investigator might and should be used only for legal purposes.  #1 Auto Forward Spy (Recommended: Best for Android phones and tablets)  Inexpensive and user friendly, Auto Forward Spy is—without a doubt—the best choice for Android and iPhone devices! It allows users to view a targeted device’s browser history, text messages, take photos remotely and much more all without having the phone in your possession. From its simple installation to its ease of use, Auto Forward Spy gives you all the benefits of mobile monitoring software with none of the hassle. It’s just download, install and monitor! With Auto Forward, you’ll be able to: Excellent customer support with LIVE people answering the phone. Of course, I called just to see if real people would actually answer the phone and if they knew what they were talking about, which they did. I was very pleased with how helpful they were. As I stated above, “stay away from monthly fees”. After trying their 3-Day Free Trial, Auto Forward Spy has a price tag of only $29.99 with no monthly fees and no additional charges. Honestly, for the money you really can’t go wrong. It’s fast, simple and easy-to-use, but most of all, it’s powerful enough to get just about anybody all the information they would ever need. Auto Forward Spy has been on the market for over 5 years and has done an excellent job in surpassing the competition. The development team of Auto Forward Spy has proven to be extremely capable of producing one of the best apps for spying on texts you will find anywhere. Visit their site: http://auto-forward.com/  #2 Highster Mobile (Best spy app for iPhones and iPads)  Highster Mobile is an SMS tracker and text message spy software that has been on the market for nearly 8 years. It has helped literally hundreds of thousands of people to spy on cell phones and in particular, gather text messages from just about any mobile device on the market. A superior text message spy, Highster Mobile not only enables a user to retrieve new text messages from any cell phone, it will also extract old and deleted text messages as well. It does this by scouring the memory of the mobile device and extracting all available old and deleted text messages that haven’t been overwritten. The astonishing thing is that you can do all this without actually having the phone in your possession. It is not uncommon for users to report the extraction of text messages from up to one-year-old. If you are spying on an iPhone and you are either unwilling or unable to jailbreak it, Highster Mobile is for you! Their No-Jailbreak program is tops in the industry and, in my opinion, is by far the easiest to use and most powerful. I found that it captures more data, in less time, than any of the competing programs. Access to the monitored device is not necessary, meaning it’s possible for you to monitor the target iPhone without installing software on it. Highster Mobile will also extract loads of data from virtually any cell phone Including; calls, GPS location (within 50 feet of the phone’s actual location), photos, videos, social media messages (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), web browsing history and much more. Activation is pretty fast and fairly simple. I used the OTA (over-the-air) method to install the program, which allows for the app to be downloaded using only a WiFi connection. I entered my license key, then the telephone number of the phone I wanted to see text messages from. Within minutes, loads of information from that phone began appearing on my cell phone. I saw all the texts that were being sent and received. I saw the content of each text, the date and time of the message and the phone number to which it was sent or received. I was pleased to see that it worked so well. Perhaps the most important feature of this program is that it comes with FREE telephone support. Any person who buys this program can actually call the 800 number on the website and speak to a live person. Currently, Highster Mobile is one of only two products I am aware of that offers free telephone support. The other is Auto Forward Spy. The program costs $29.99 and has no additional charges and no monthly fees. It also comes with free lifetime upgrades so you never have to buy another SMS (text) tracking program again. Because of its exceptional functionality and reliability and its low price point, Highster Mobile is a good choice. Visit their site: http://www.highstermobile.com/ #3 PhoneSpector (Best all around spy app)  PhoneSpector is my personal choice for the best spy app on the market. It represents the departure from traditional iPhone and Android spy apps to a more powerful, in-depth and easy-to-use app that is a better fit for today’s mobile devices. Because it is a “utility app”, it can dig deeper into file structures of cell phones or tablets and possibly extract more information than a traditional spy app can. Superb for spying on text messages and iMessages, you will not find a better text spy app, or cell phone spy app than PhoneSpector. Read more about PhoneSpector #4 DDI Utilities (Net-generation utility app)  DDI Utilities is used primarily for backup and data recovery of mobile devices, but what they don’t tell you is you also can use this program to spy on a cell phone without having the phone in your possession. DDI will enable you to see virtually everything that happens on a cell phone or tablet without actually having the device in your hands. It does this by establishing a remote connection with the monitored device and uploading that data to your secure online account. The reason I prefer DDI Utilities over traditional “spy” programs is simple. It’s more powerful. It can get more information and most important, it gets deleted texts and other data from the phone. Visit their site: https://ddiutilities.com/   The internet is a dangerous place. Full of dangerous people. Hackers, haters, scammers, cyber stalkers, perverts, pedos—the online world is a virtual devil’s playground. A world that we carry along with us in our hands. So how can you protect the ones you love from those seeking to do harm? And how can you safeguard those you entrust with your devices against misuse? Installing cell phone spy software that allows you to view text messages, track social media activity, access browsing history, view call logs. and more is a step in the right direction. Each of these spyware apps come with their merits, but if you’re looking for the absolute best of the bunch, then look no further than SurePoint, Auto Forward, and Highster Mobile. With their ease of installation and use—and low cost—these three products are the top choices in the market today. With functions that allow you to take photos remotely, view browser history, view text messages, track via a GPS and much more, these three software programs will definitely give you the most bang for your buck. And there are no hidden fees or monthly costs. Other cell phone spy software might promise more, but read the fine print on their offers to make sure there are no recurring monthly costs. The three I mentioned all have a one-time fee. So, if you are looking to protect your children from online predators, obscene websites or overall bad decisions—or you want to keep a watchful eye on employees who may misuse your devices while on your company’s time and dime—look no further than the high-quality products in this review. Many existing spyware apps can track another device’s whereabouts, let you view its pictures and videos and help you spy on text messages, but not every one of them is alike. Here are some important qualities to look for in mobile tracking software: You shouldn’t have to be a rocket scientist to navigate through the software’s web-based control panel. A good app should make it easy for anyone to check chat logs, see text messages, or follow a device via the GPS. The same should go for installing the software. Once you purchase the product, the company will send you an email that will take you step by step through the installation process. Most installations should take only a few minutes and be ready to work immediately upon completion. Many of the available cell phone monitoring systems that track text messages share similar features, but some vary. It’s up to you to do your homework and figure out which one is right for you needs. Each app should have a multitude of functions that work to give you the answers you seek quickly, easily and without complication. While most of the spy apps that intercept text messages are in a similar price range, some can be costlier than others. Most are a one-time purchase, but there are those that also charge a monthly fee. Find out which product works best for you and your budget before you buy. And beware of any that look too good to be true. Like anything, there are opportunists out there looking to make a quick buck with shoddy software. But an inexpensive software shouldn’t stop you from having the best and most powerful features, like GPS locator or the ability to see texts. These features should always be available on any decent cell phone spy application. Stealth is one of the most important aspects of a cell phone spy and text message tracker. Being able to track another person’s cell phone or tablet usage undetected is of utmost importance to the purchaser. The hard truth is that if you want to spy on SMS texts, listen in on phone calls, and take pictures remotely without being detected, you’re going to need a good spyware app. One that is invisible and untraceable at all times.   Using spy apps, you will be able to spy on another person’s texts. iMessages, SMS messages, private messages, and social media messages. View text contents including messages, photos, videos, links, and more. Monitoring text messages is legal as long as it’s your child, or your employee’s company-owned device and you have their permission. Yes, there are plenty of apps that can track text messages from iOS and Android phones and tablets. The ones we recommended from our experience are Highster Mobile and Auto Forward. With a text message spy app, you can view: The company will send you step-by-step instructions via email on how to download, install, and activate your software after you make the purchase. The process is very quick and very easy. You’ll be up and running in minutes. Yes, but it is a near-painless procedure. Once the iPhone is Jailbroken however, the installation is a snap. Not at all. The software runs in stealth mode at all times—making you virtually invisible as you spy on text messages and other phone activities. Not necessarily. Check the software’s webpage before purchasing to be sure that the product will work in your area. Yes. If someone has installed a spy or monitoring application on your phone, they will be able to see all text messages you’ve sent and received. If this is being done without your knowledge, we recommend:   Notifications We believe everyone should be able to make buying decisions with confidence.

        "body": " Due to the quality and good reputation of the app, mSpy is the trustworthy market leader, with only FlexiSPY as their main competitor. Though both apps offer similar functions, mSpy has the edge when it comes to pricing. In this review, we will discuss which functions mSpy offers and what their pricing schemes are. Download mSpy The mSpy app has versions to monitor almost any modern device. The service started as simple mobile phone monitoring software in 2011. But with the development of current tablets and smartphones, newer versions and updates of the app offered an ever-increasing list of services. The software has been adapted to monitor almost any internet-enabled device. They have versions for Android smartphone or tablet, iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. You will also find computer monitoring versions for both Windows PCs and Apple Macs. Depending on which target device you wish to track, you will need to buy a different version of the software. Since operating systems get frequent updates, you should visit their website for the latest versions available. They also provide a handy list of all the makes and models supported. Keep in mind that the release of the software you should choose depends not on the model you have but preferably on the model you wish to track.  This feature is popular with parents and employers alike. Geofencing allows you to set up certain restricted areas using Google Maps. As soon as the device enters one of the restricted areas, you will get an alert. You can choose to receive an email any time this happens, or it can show up as an alert on the Online Dashboard. Of course, this service also comes with a log of all of the devices’ locations, which can be set for any desired period. mSpy’s Geofencing is one of the software’s main functions and one of the reasons the app has become so popular. The folks at mSpy are working hard every day to monitor every new messenger or social media app that is launched. It is especially crucial for younger users who are prone to download and experiment with different apps for communication. Of course, no monitoring solution would be complete without the ability to monitor communication apps. If a mobile spy app does not monitor your child’s or employee’s social apps, is there even a point in having one at all? Right now, mSpy keeps track of all messages from WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, SnapChat, Viber, Skype, Line, Telegram, iMessage, Instagram, and Twitter. Tinder is another app that was just added, and mSpy is one of the only apps that can monitor both Tinder and Snapchat! It allows you to not only read the contents of each message but see all shared images and videos as well. mSpy monitoring service for messenger and social media apps is the most powerful on the market.  It is one way to keep your child away from undesirable friends, or even trolls and stalkers. Certain apps, such as Tinder, are not for children to use. And you would not want your employees casually flirting with your company phone. The app allows you to block any undesirable app on your target device. Additionally, you can pause or delete apps that are already installed. It adds another layer of security. With the mSpy app, you can block access to any list of websites you choose. You can block certain websites completely, or choose only to allow them during certain time slots. It is a way to keep your employees from wasting valuable company time on entertainment websites or to keep your children focused when they should be doing their homework. You can also block specific categories, such as adult content completely. You can even go so far as to prevent the internet entirely. The Keylogger is another feature exclusive to mSpy. It will let you see everything that is typed on the device, from emails, text messages, to URLs, logins, and more. This feature is only available for parental control for Android for now, but it is expected to become available for Apple devices as well soon. Using public Wi-Fi on business devices can prove to be a threat. Especially, if said devices contain sensitive and valuable information, such as bank details, logins, and other passwords. With mSpy’s Wi-Fi monitoring, you can monitor every Wi-Fi connection the target device makes. The app will show you a list with every connection ever made, and it gives you the option to restrict access to public hotspots remotely. Other security features include phone locking, data wiping, and SIM change notifications. Thanks to these features, mSpy can boast a complete offer when it comes to parental controls and mobile spy software. If you wish to track an Apple device that has not had a jailbreak, there is no need to perform a jailbreak. It is a relatively new development, and it is available for all Apple products, including iPhones, iPads, etc. This type of software works slightly differently from the rest of the mSpy software. In the case of no jailbreak monitoring, no software needs to be downloaded on the target device. Instead, you need to use the device’s Apple ID and password. The device must be set up to use Apple’s automatic backup service. If set up correctly, no notifications will be sent to the device or the iCloud. Sign in to iCloud using the password of the device and allow mSpy access. mSpy will then display reports in your mSpy Online Dashboard. The software will enable you to see: When it comes to a messenger or social media monitoring, the options are fewer than the regular versions. Though, you can still monitor Skype, WhatsApp, Line, and other messenger services. No Jailbreak monitoring has some limitations compared to routine monitoring, but if jailbreaking is not an option, this is your best choice. mSpy has several features that will make it very easy for you to monitor your target device. You can log in anywhere to receive reports. Alternatively, you can choose to have them uploaded as soon as you have a Wi-Fi connection, and you can pause reporting at any time. That way, your target device will not have to use too much data to upload. While location reports use a relatively small amount of data, if you choose to monitor images and videos, it will use a lot more. You can set time intervals for reporting or choose for real-time reports. It all depends on your needs. The software will update automatically, and there is no need to access the target device once the software been installed. The software is very flexible, whether you are monitoring one device or dozens of them. It makes it a perfect tool, both for parents wishing to monitor their children and for small to medium-sized businesses that need to control their employee’s devices.  The Basic version comes with the following features: The Premium version has even more advanced features, including social media and messenger app monitoring. It also includes access to Wi-Fi networks, the ability to block apps and websites, incoming call blocking and geofencing. The mSpy Basic package is only available for 1 month or more and costs $29.99. We recommend that if you simply wish to test the software. The Premium package will actually give you much better value for money, especially if you choose the one-year package. In that case, mSpy will only cost you the equivalent of $16.67 per month. A small price to pay for peace of mind. mSpy also has a refund policy, though this is somewhat limited. It applies only for the first subscription and for 14 days only. If you have technical issues with the software in this period, you can get a full refund. However, mSpy does offer considerable support to ensure this will not be necessary. Their team can even help you jailbreak or root a mobile device remotely, to ensure their software will work. If you want to know what mSpy dashboard looks like, head over to their site for a demo. There, you can see what each part of the dashboard looks like, giving yourself a good idea of what you can expect once you have installed the app. mSpy is beating its competitors by offering an all-in-one service for monitoring every aspect of the target device. Thanks to their innovative dashboard, you can get an accessible overview of the device’s activity. You can choose between blocking or simply monitoring. It makes it the complete spy service available, and for just $16.67 per month, it also boasts the most competitive price.

        "body": "Hillstone Reviews, News and Tips  mSpy is a leading parental control software. WhatsApp, messages, Snapchat, and calls can all be monitored with this app. It also gives access to the GPS location of an individual but how does mSpy work? It can quickly be installed and has a friendly interface that can easily be navigated. The app is suitable for Windows PC, Android devices as well as Mac OS. It is popular among parents who find it handy in keeping an eye on what they kids engage in from the comfort of their homes. Its multi-language feature means that it is suitable for numerous regions around the world. The tracking app is installed onto the device that will be monitored. The app’s icon is then hid to keep the user in the dark concerning its existence. They still can’t interfere with its settings even when they eventually discover it. mSpy gets access to every activity on the target device after being installed. From your online dashboard you can view and assess data on the phone. Contact details, text messages and call logs will all be at your disposal. The target phone needs to be connected to the internet for it to send you information. Any location with good internet connection can support its operations. From your dashboard you can view the target phone’s model, the memory space available, remaining battery life, operating system and the cellular service provider. Your dashboard also allows you to execute some functions remotely. You can lock the target device, wipe out all logs, reboot the phone remotely, unlink the target device and disable the software. The app has a feature that enables you to monitor and block different websites visited by the user. You can deny the user access to some sites if you wish to. The blocking feature is however browser dependent as the user can go around it when they use Operamini. Before the app can operate in an iPhone, the device will have to be jailbroken first. You can however gain access to the iPhone device through iCloud but this will deny mSpy some features on the target phone. Once you jailbreak the device, access the Cydia app and enter the download link here. With this done the software can be downloaded and installed on the target device. Using iCloud to run mSpy on an iPhone will provide access to information and data that is backed up on iCloud. This will be possible once you turn on the iCloud backup option of the target device. You will then need information about the account to be able to gain access to data on iCloud. iCloud allows the user to backup call logs, photos, text messages, GPS locations, account details, contacts and safari bookmarks. All these will also be available on the mSpy app. With iCloud, you won’t be able to view WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter or web browsers and third party apps. Information on the target phone will also only be accessed after it has been backed up. Though jailbreaking may feel cumbersome, it remains the best option for full access on a target iPhone. To download the software on an android device, you will need to root the device and have stable internet connection. Because android devices do not accept apps that have not been installed from the Play Store, you will enable unknown sources. Then you can simply download and install the software. You can then link the target device from your dashboard after hiding the mSpy icon. mSpy on an android device will enable you to monitor call and text history, emails, chat messaging alerts, GPS location, web history as well as memo updates. You also get remote access to the device. This feature allows you to restrict access to different software and apps. Another added feature is that you can monitor numerous devices at the same time. Once the app has been downloaded and installed free updates are can be gotten every time a new version is released. You can also get free live help from the service providers at all times. They guarantee privacy and safety of the information that you monitor with the app. mSpy gives you unlimited access to a remote device.

        "body": "⚠ FlexiSPY does not run surreptitiously as it offers the user the choice of showing the icon on the device if required. Spy phone software being hidden has now become a feature itself and one of the most important ones. On Android, there are many places where spy phone software that is advertised as being hidden can possibly be found and this article will compare Mspy with FlexiSPY on Android to see which ones delivers on the website promise of the software being completely undetectable. It was not Mspy. During our testing of Mspy for Android it was easy to find Mspy on the TARGET device because, when spy phone software says it is undetectable it usually means just hiding the program icon and nothing more. Because we could find Mspy we then perform the same tests with FlexiSPY so you can really see which Android spy phone software makes true on its website promise of being completely hidden once installed on to an Android phone. Mspy advertise that their software is in fact 100% undetectable but this is not the case. Mspy is not completely invisible and can be detected. Here is what we found. Even though Mspy hides its own icon it still gets flagged as a virus so the phone owner can see that, notice something wrong has been installed and quickly remove it. FlexiSPY, on the other hand, is not classed as a virus in any way when scanned. On a rooted phone, there will always be the SuperSU icon which appears after you have successfully rooted it. Because you need root permission to get the most out of Mspy the phone owner will immediately notice this new icon and they can then tap it to view Mspy listed inside and can then set about removing it. FlexiSPY not only hides the SuperSU icon but also itself from inside SuperSU. This means that only FlexiSPY hides itself completely on a rooted Android phone when compared to Mspy. Even on a rooted phone Mspy still appears in the application manager menu. All it takes is the phone owner to see an unfamiliar program has been installed and for them to perform a few taps to remove it and then Mspy is gone. Once FlexiSPY has been installed on to an Android phone it no longer appears in the application manager menu and cannot be removed the same way that Mspy can. The more technical Android user will be familiar with task manager software as it allows them to see how their phone is performing and see which applications use up the most memory or battery for example. This same software also lists Mspy and allows for it to be uninstalled completely. But because FlexiSPY is completely once installed on to an Android phone not even task manager software can find it. Even though the software icon is hidden, in the phone browser, being able to see the download URL means that the phone owner can simply go to the website listed and immediately know that Mspy has been installed and they can then remove it using the other methods outlined above. To be the best spy phone software you need to be undetected. Mspy is not undetectable as their website says and can easily be found in a variety of places. FlexiSPY hides itself far better than Mspy and deals with rooting and hiding itself and SuperSU in a far better way than Mspy too. FlexiSPY is therefore clearly the obvious choice for Android spy phone software for those who wish to spy on a rooted Android phone and remain undetected whilst doing it. They even help with the Android rooting process which other competitors do not. Below you can find the detailed specifications of Mspy used during testing, the Android TARGET device and further information about all software used during testing.

        "body": "CategoriesBlog My ReviewsMy Settings HelpLOG OUT SH ShellyUS For businesses Your review counts! You reviewed mSpy Monitoring Soft Add photo SH Shelly 1 review Just now LIARS AND SCAMMERS PEASE do not be fooled by these people. I was looking for an app that would monitor Snapchat on an IPhone without jailbreaking the phone. After hours of online research I found mspy. Many people had written about it being a good choice and capable of doing what I needed. The people that wrote these things must have been working for mspy, because they lied. On the mspy web page blog there was a post by mspy giving people specific directions to set up to monitor Snapchat on an Iphone without jailbreaking. In addition I went to the mspy chat and asked specifically if mspy is capable of doing this... the response was yes. I figured this was enough confirmation and gave them my money for a one year subscription. What followed was days of me trying to set this up on the target phone and MANY calls and online chats. It would not monitor a single thing on the phone even aside from Snapchat. Finally in another chat I again asked for help and finally got the truth in response. They told me that mspy is not able to monitor Snapchat without jailbreaking the phone. I went through the online procedures to explain how they mislead me and requested a refund. I received a reply saying they would not refund my money because my reason was classified as a personal dislike of the app and not covered under their refund policy. I finally was able to get a person on the phone and told him what the email said and explained to him that it was not a personal reason... it was the result of them scamming me into buying something I could not use. The person on the phone said that I already had their response and he couldn't help me but I could email them again. I told him I had been getting ignored and put off for a week and needed to speak to his supervisor. A supervisor named Alex called me and explained everything AGAIN. At first he said he had no record of the original chat saying yes (before I purchased meaning yes it would do what I needed) so they would not refund. Then I said even if that's true what about the false directions posted telling people how to monitor without jailbreak? He said if I could send a screenshot of this he would process the refund. I sent the screenshot. I received a reply that said it was still a personal reason but they would offer me a 30% refund and I could still use the software to monitor the device for the length I purchased. I guess they forgot that I told them IT NEVER MONITORED ANYTHING ON THE PHONE! To this lame offer I responded: This is NOT acceptable. THIS IS RIDICULOUS! I spoke with Alex on the phone. I was lied to by your chat person and the website that this would monitor Snapchat without jailbreak before I bought it. After days of not being able to get this to work I was told it would not work without jailbreak. You are liars and scammers. I have spent weeks trying to get you to do the right thing with emails and phone calls and you keep giving lame excuses and trying to avoid accepting responsibility. Alex told me when I provided the screenshot proving you mislead people online he would move forward with my refund. Instead you offer me 30% and the ability to continue using it to monitor... THIS NEVER WORKED... I AM NOT ABLE TO MONITOR ANYTHING! UNBELIEVABLE! If you do not give me the full refund I will post everything I mentioned here on every possible review site I can and report you to Better Business, Consumer Affairs, and anywhere else I can to warn people away from your lies and scams. I will post the screenshot where you lied and the chat where you tell me I can't use it without jailbreak. Refund my FULL amount! Now they are ignoring me. I have sent 2 more emails asking for the status of my refund and have gotten nothing. DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE YOUR MONEY! I continue to try to get a refund from mdpy. This is my latest response to them after they offered me partial a partial refund.. NOT ACCEPTABLE! I cannot believe you are still trying to blame me for your lies. You say the requirements are on the website to review before purchase.... as my previous emails state...I DID REVIEW THE REQUIREMENTS... YOUR WEBSITE SAYS IT MONITORS SNAPCHAT WITHOUT JAILBREAK. IN CHAT I ASKED SOMEONE BEFORE BUYING IF IT MONITORS SNAPCHAT I WAS TOLD YES! IT DOES NOT! Now you continue to lie... I was told by supervisor Alex that my refund would be processed when I provided a screenshot proving that you lie to people online by posting directions to monitor Snapchat on an Iphone without jailbreak to scam them into buying mspy and then tell them you can't without jailbreak. I provided the screenshot and you offer me 30% and then 70%. THIS IS 100% YOUR FAULT, 100% YOUR LIES, 100% YOUR SCAM! GIVE ME 100% REFUND. I warned people on Reddit, Trustpilot, and Sitejabber about mspy. I will continue to report your scam on as many platforms as possible. DO THE RIGHT THING I wish I read all these reviews before Mspy is total scam! dang I wanted to use this without jailbreak.... this sounds awful im so sorry:'/ any update? Terrible company with no moral values. Bought 3mo of service and after 2 hours of troubleshooting, I couldn't even sign into the app on my daughter's phone. I never even got to use the service. Contacted support to request a refund. After a week or 2 of them telling me \"sorry, too bad.\" I'm fed up. Unbelievable thieves. Mspy company are complete scammers! The software doesnot work on idevices and according to them requires an installation with technician, which is not stated on their site. The software is not discreet either. On the child phone you have to download mspy. Garbage software with awful customer service! Dont waste your money on scam! Just call Your CC company and dispute. I went to buy oysters and prawns there today. Seen that the sign on oysters said \"Coffin Bay\" (which all over the news has been recalled). I showed the salesperson the news article where he said \"I dont know where they are from, we just put that sign up there\". Coiffin Bay Oysters have put people in hospital as well as very sick. Disapointing when they dont know where their seafood is from Members Online"

        "body": "I've had this product for about 2 weeks and as of about a week ago I've had nothing but issues. For some reason the target device is not providing any data for contacts, calls, keyword logs or emails (actually never did for emails). Text messages were only updated once and that was when I uninstalled and reinstalled the program as instructed. Any advice? Hey - this is my 1st reddit post....not sure if this is how this works.....but I wanted to share this out. I signed up for mSpy because my son got an iPhone for Christmas. The customer service has been poor but I was still holding out hope that that product would work....because it sounds cool. I'm not saying it doesn't....but it doesn't work for me (yet) and I just learned this from their customer service:   Dear customer, Thank you for contacting us. Please be advised that Apple has recently re-enforced their security causing the problems with iCloud monitoring when the two-factor authentication is enabled on the target iOS device. Our Development Team has already developed a solution for the devices operating on iOS 9.0 – 11.0. They are finding the way to make the monitoring of iOS 11.0.1 – 13 with the two-factor authentication possible again. Meanwhile, we are glad to offer the following alternative solutions for you: If the two-factor authentication has been enabled within the past 2 weeks you can actually disable it. In order to do so please sign in to the mailbox connected to your kid’s iCloud account and find the enrollment confirmation letter. Then click “Return to previous security settings”. You can try to ask Apple Support to disable the two-factor authentication for your kid’s iCloud account. Just simply tell them that the two-factor authentication is inconvenient for you. Please use this link to contact them: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201232 Register a new iCloud account on appleid.com and change the iCloud account on your child’s iPhone. (You can keep the old iCloud account for App Store on the iPhone). I find reddit to be the most trustworthy place for advice on software, but there is nothing about mspy here. I found this article that says it's worh the money. Can somebody here confirm or deny any of the facts? Members Online"

        "desc": "mSpy is a completely legal software that has been designed for the purpose of being used by Parents and Employers. If you use mSpy in those capacities, or on your own phone, then you're perfectly clear. However, if you use mSpy to spy on anyone else, then you might be treading on a very grey area.",
        "body": "Table of Contents ** This post was updated on: September 26, 2019 ** Are you a parent worried about the kind of crowd your kid has been hanging with? Are you concerned about your teenager’s online activities? Are you an employer suspicious of the fact that one of your employees might be leaking trade secrets? Are you afraid that your spouse may be cheating on you? Or are you just someone who really needs a monitoring device to spy with? If you identify with any of the scenarios stated above, you’re at the right place. To be able to spy you don’t need to go jumping off buildings or climbing walls like James Bond, you just need a good spy app. And in this article I’ll give you all the details you need to know about one of the best hidden spy apps in the market – mSpy. Over the course of this mSpy reviews, I’ll tell you exactly what is mSpy, how it works, what its unique features are, why it’s better or worse than other spy apps in the market, how to install it and spy with it, and anything else you might want to know. So read on for a detailed review of mSpy. mSpy is one of the highly professional mobile spy apps that has been developed primarily for the benefit of parents and employers. However, even though it is legally created for their benefit, it can really be used by anyone at all. This is a powerful monitoring tool that can give you complete uninhibited access to your target individuals phone. And you know how it is, if you control someone’s phone, you control their whole lives. Think about it, if you can hijack someone’s phone, you get access to all of their contacts, calendars, browser history, social media accounts, etc. However, this sheer strength of power afforded by spy apps like mSpy can be a good and a bad thing. I’m obliged to let you know that you shouldn’t use this spy app for unethical purposes like stalking someone, as that can be dangerous and illegal. And in this case, you may even risk imprisonment if you do so. So you should ideally use it as parents monitoring minors, employers monitoring your employees’ company phones, or perhaps under extreme circumstances spousal monitoring.  However, even in these cases where it’s perfectly legal to spy on someone’s phone, you probably are hesitant to do so because you don’t want to risk losing your target’s faith. For example, kids are likely to lose trust in their parents if they find out their parents are monitoring them, and employees are likely to develop ill will towards their employer, if they find out they’re being monitored. As such, mSpy offers you a completely discreet means of monitoring on someone’s phone without them being aware of it. Once you install the software into a phone, it runs in the background and becomes virtually invisible. As long as the phone has an internet connection, all the data from that phone would get transmitted to you. If all of this sounds too complex for you, then don’t worry. mSpy is actually very user-friendly and also comes with great customer support available via email, live chat, or phone. So now that you have a brief idea about what Spy apps are in general, and what mSpy is specifically, we can talk about how does mSpy fare against its competitors. After all, in a free market capitalist society, the quality or strength of a product is only determined by the quality of its competitors. Most of the primary features of mSpy like call logging, message viewing, accessing browser history, etc, are common to all the other spy apps as well. This makes sense because these are the very basic functions of spy apps. However, there are also certain areas in which mSpy is unique and excels far above all of its competitors. Most spy apps require you to jailbreak iPhone so that you can install the app and give it access to the iPhone. While mSpy is one of the first spy apps that can spy iPhone without jailbreak. In fact, with mSpy you even have the ability to spy on a phone without even installing the software into it. However, to gain access to the iPhone’s contents without jailbreak you need access to the target’s iCloud account. You can check the below video about how to track an iPhone without jailbreak via mSpy. If you want to install mSpy on Android and see how it works, you can directly go to PART 6. In the table given below, you can find out which features can be accessed with or without jailbreak. mSpy is one of the best Android keyloggers which can be used to find out a user’s passwords. It’s true that if you have access to someone’s entire phone you don’t need their password to access their social media or mail. However, if you want to access their accounts normally, without the use of spy software, you’ll need their password. This is where this feature comes in. Keylogging allows you to gain access to all the buttons being pressed in the target iPhone. This will not only let you view all messages being sent out of the phone, but also give you access to all of the user’s passwords, which you can later use at your own will.

However, you do have the ability to split your time with one mSpy account amongst many devices. You can deactivate one and activate the other. Most other spy apps don’t even allow you to install the app on any other device. You have to monitor just one device for the entire duration of your license. Most other spy apps have limited customer support. Some of them require you to fill up a form and wait for a reply, some of them require you to send emails, and as such they can be annoying in times when you’re in a rush. mSpy gives you complete access to technical assistance 24/7, using a chat window, email, or even phone. Furthermore, if you’re a pro spy you can even purchase their mAssistance for $43.99, which gives you complete access to a personal assistant who can help you out with all your technical needs.

This is useful if you find out that your kids are interacting with someone they shouldn’t be chatting with. This feature allows you to gain complete access to their mailbox, and so you can find out all the sites that they’re subscribed to, all the people they’re chatting with, and the contents of the emails they’re sending.

You can use it to make sure your children are coming back home directly after a school. Or if they’re late, you can find out whether they’re stuck in traffic or if they have gone off somewhere else. This is especially helpful to keep little children safe. This feature allows you to set up a perimeter for the target phone. So whenever the target individual goes beyond that perimeter, you’ll directly receive an alert on your device. You can find out exactly what they’re surfing for online, for how long, and when.

As mentioned earlier, mSpy is a non-jailbreak solution as long as you have the target’s iCloud account. However, this is limited. While most of the essential features can be accessed without jailbreaking, there are other features which cannot be accessed without jailbreaking the iPhone and installing the software. mSpy is highly compatible with all the popular devices, iOS, Android, Windows and Mac. mSpy has received little to no complaints regarding compatibility, and as such it is a pretty universal app. mSpy is one of the easiest apps to install, and within 15 minutes you can be all set up and you can start monitoring any phone you wish to. However, different devices have slightly different installation processes. As mentioned earlier as well, for an iPhone, if you choose to go with the jailbreaking function, you’ll need a direct access to the target phone, you’ll have to jailbreak it, and then install it. If you choose the no-jailbreak option, then you’ll need the iCloud account details and you’ll be able to sync your device to theirs without much difficulty. Below you’ll find the broad outline of steps you need to follow. mSpy has one of the most flexible and vast price packages in the market, and the license for them can be bought for either a month, 3 months, or a year. mSpy offers one of the best customer support teams amongst all the different spy apps in the market. Because you may need immediate assistance at any moment, they have a 24/7 service. You can reach them via live chat, emails, or even by phone. However, this option is available to you based on your subscription package. A Basic Plan will only fetch you email support. However, a Premium Plan can get you email or live chat support as well. You can even ask for a telephonic support, which can be purchased for $12.99. This support will walk you through all the steps of installation. Furthermore, if you purchase mAssistance for $43.99, as mentioned earlier, you get access to your own personal assistant who can even guide you through the jailbreak process, or conduct it for you. If you have a general problem with mSpy installation or download which can’t be solved by the customer support either, then you’ll be eligible for a complete refund. However, this refund comes with conditions applied. Because of the discretion that you need to maintain while using a spy app, it is imperative that your app company is 100% reliable. mSpy, I am happy to say, is a completely reliable company because it never works in the shadows. The presence of mSpy is known and acknowledged worldwide. It has received international acclaim, and has a 95% customer satisfaction rating. In fact, they’ve received endorsements from outlets as well known and trustworthy as CNet, The Huffington Post, abc, Forbes, Fox News, Lifewire, Daily Mail, CNN, amongst many others as well. mSpy also has a plethora of great testimonials from happy customers from across the globe. You can check out all their reviews and endorsements at the bottom of their Landing Page. If you want to know mSpy alternative, you can also check my review on other mSpy competitors: FlexiSPY review and Highster Mobile review. mSpy is compatible with all network carriers and works regardless of the geographical location of the device. As such, mSpy will continue to function as long as the target phone receives a stable and strong internet connection as the information needs to be transmitted to your control panel. mSpy only works in the background mode. Furthermore, the logo that comes up after the installation can easily be disabled and removed from the dashboard. mSpy is a completely legal software that has been designed for the purpose of being used by Parents and Employers. If you use mSpy in those capacities, or on your own phone, then you’re perfectly clear. However, if you use mSpy to spy on anyone else, then you might be treading on a very grey area. And as such, you should familiarize yourself with your state’s privacy laws. On an iPhone, if you choose to install mSpy without jailbreaking, then you can install it remotely. However, if you choose to avail of the complete set of features by jailbreaking iPhone then you’ll need about 15 minutes of access to the target phone. You also need physical access to the phone if it’s an Android. However, if you choose to get this done through mAssistance, they can jailbreak and install mSpy without your involvement. iOS: Enter Cydia > Installed > iPhoneInternalService > Modify > Remove. Android: Enter the Phone Settings > Security > Device Administrators > Update Service > Deactivate > Settings > Apps > Update Service > Uninstall. Overall, I believe mSpy is understandably the king of spy apps at the moment. It is perfect for both Families and Professional settings, as it offers a breadth of features. So you can purchase it accordingly based on the flexible packages. You also have the ability to go for a non-jailbreak solution, even though it restricts some of the most sophisticated features. While it might be a little difficult to install, it’s still a lot simpler than many of its competitors. Furthermore, mSpy is an extremely reliable company and always handles your discretion well. It has enough systems in place so that your kids or your employees would never find out that they’re being monitored, unless you tell them yourself. I only beseech that you use the app ethically and stay safe. However, I’d love to hear what you have to think about this. What are your takes on spy apps, do you think they’re wrong or perfectly justified? Has this mSpy app review post proven helpful to you? If you have any other questions, do leave them down in the comments section and I’ll get back to you with an answer soon as I can!

        "body": "As many of our readers may be aware, spyware is no longer reserved for the most technically-minded amongst us. The software needed to hack someone’s phone is now readily available to buy for as little as $30. The consequence of that is, now, occurrences of hacking are much more common than in the past. Mainly due to the availability of commercial spyware along with the fact that someone can hack your phone with virtually no in-depth technical knowledge at all. The most popular version of this commercially available spyware is called ‘mSpy’. mSpy is a software product that touts itself as being the ‘ultimate monitoring software for parental control’. The problem is that people aren’t using this software just for parental control. Something the company appears to be well aware of based on a recent advert seen on Twitter promoting mSpy as a way of spying on your partner. mSpy have two main products for Android – ‘mSpy Android Monitoring’ which is their main product (and the most intrusive of the two) – only available via their website and ‘mLite Family Phone Tracker, GPS Location App’ which is their ‘lite’ version of their software, available on Google Play. Let’s take a look at both of these versions and talk about why they are a threat to your digital security.

Let’s take a look at both of these versions and talk about why they are a threat to your digital security. As I mentioned above, this is mSpy’s main product and is only available via their website. The main difference with this software/app is that it has a lot more features compared to the lite version and allows much more in-depth monitoring and tracking. Here’s a list of the main features: As you can see, this software is actually really powerful considering the price a hacker would pay to get access. One thing worth noting, unlike iPhones, an Android device does not need to be Rooted for many of these features to work. This makes installation a lot easier for the hacker when the victim has an Android phone or tablet. As opposed to mSpy’s main Android spyware product we looked at above, this is a fairly simple app designed to do one thing – track your location. If a hacker installs this onto your device, then they will be able to see where your device is at all times. Obviously, this isn’t as useful for a hacker compared to the full version, but this is really easy to install (as easy as downloading any other app on the Play store). It’s not always easy to detect if this type of software has actually been installed on your device. This is fairly simple. It’s not possible to hide mLite, so just have a look at your installed apps. If you see it, all you would need to do is just delete the app and it will not be able to continue tracking your location. To stay safe in the future, it’s recommended to only allow location tracking on your phone for apps that you know need it (e.g. maps, etc).  The full version of mSpy is designed to be hidden from the user, and does this very well. That’s why we have developed our own Certo Mobile Security app designed to help Android users detect and destroy privacy invading spyware, including both versions of mSpy. On top of that, our app can also find and fix insecure system settings that put your phone at risk, prevent unauthorized access to your data and help keep you protected online. All of which will help to reduce your risk of a potentially devastating privacy breach.

Pasos para el uso.",
        "body": "En el mundo actual, la tecnología está cada vez más presente en al vida de las personas. El acceso a Internet está al alcance de cualquier individuo que disponga de un teléfono celular. Hoy en día hasta los niños poseen uno, y están expuestos a los peligros de Internet. Es por eso que los padres se ven obligados a utilizar aplicaciones de espionaje, para poder revisar y controlar la actividad del niño. Este es solo un ejemplo, existen varias razones para espiar la actividad ajena: miedo a una infidelidad, la ineficacia de los trabajadores en una empresa, o incluso la pura curiosidad del ser humano respecto a la intimidad de otras personas. En el mercado actual, existen muchas aplicaciones de espionaje. Sin embargo, pocas son realmente efectivas. La mayoría son defectuosas, e incluso peligrosas, ya que bajo la premisa de acceder a un celular ajeno, terminan invadiendo el celular propio y robando información. Aquí es donde se destaca mSpy, la mejor aplicación de espionaje en todo el mercado de apps. mSpy es una aplicación de espionaje de alto nivel profesional, que fue desarrollada principalmente para el beneficio de padres y empleadores. Sin embargo, puede ser utilizada por cualquier persona, con cualquier objetivo. Esta poderosa herramienta de monitoreo proporciona acceso total al teléfono que se desea espiar. Al utilizar la aplicación, se puede observar los contactos, el historial de navegación, las redes sociales, el calendario, entre otras funciones que se desarrollarán detalladamente más adelante.  La aplicación fue desarrollada para dos objetivos fundamentales. La primera de ellas es para los padres que desean controlar a sus hijos menores de edad. La segunda es para monitorear empleados de una empresa que utilicen celulares proporcionados por la propia compañía.Para esto hay que instalar mSpy en un dispositivo móvil. “Un gran poder conlleva una gran responsabilidad” es una buena frase que aplica en una aplicación de espionaje. En caso de querer espiar a un amigo, o intentar descubrir una infidelidad de una pareja, la responsabilidad recae en su totalidad en el individuo, con los riesgos que esto conlleva. El peligro de ser descubierto y la ilegalidad de las acciones son asumidos al usar la aplicación. Para estar más tranquilos, los usuarios pueden consultar un profesional de leyes, como un abogado. Incluso en las situaciones legales ya mencionadas, existen ciertos riesgos. Por ejemplo, si un niño o adolescente descubre que es monitoreado por sus padres, puede perder toda confianza hacia ellos, o si los empleados de una empresa saben que son controlados todo el tiempo, pueden comenzar a sentir odio o ira hacia sus jefes. Sin embargo, una de las características fundamentales que distinguen a mSpy es su discreción. Es prácticamente imposible que una persona se entere si es espiada con esta aplicación. Una vez completado el proceso de instalación, la app funciona en segundo plano y se vuelve invisible. Mientras el celular tenga conexión a internet, toda la información será transmitida hacia el panel de control.  El mercado de apps de espionaje es bastante amplio. mSpy es la mejor de ellas. Las funciones primarias, como acceso a historial de navegación, mensajes, llamadas, etc., son compartidas con otras aplicaciones de monitoreo, pero esto se justifica porque son funciones básicas de cualquier aplicación de este estilo. Hay ciertas áreas y funciones particulares que solo mSpy ofrece y se destaca por sobre sus competidores: La mayoría de apps requieren un jailbreak para poder acceder a un iPhone. En cambio, mSpy es la primera que puede espiar un iPhone sin realizar un jailbreak. Es mas, mSpy ofrece la posibilidad de espiar un celular sin tener que instalar un software en el dispositivo. Para llevar a cabo esta opción, se necesita el acceso a la cuenta de iCloud del usuario de iPhone. La función sin jailbreak ofrece la mayoría de las opciones básicas de monitoreo. mSpy funciona como Keylogger, lo que permite descubrir las contraseñas del usuario. A priori parece innecesario conocer las contraseñas si se puede acceder al celular en su totalidad, pero en caso de querer acceder a las cuentas de la forma tradicional, sin utilizar el software de monitoreo, es una posibilidad disponible. Si bien mSpy no permite usar la misma licencia para espiar diferentes dispositivos al mismo tiempo, si permite ir rotando entre varios celulares. Solo basta con desactivar uno y activar otro. Otras aplicaciones no permiten instalar la aplicación en más de un dispositivo. La mayoría de las apps tienen un soporte al cliente limitado. Requieren llenar formularios y esperar una respuesta, la cual puede tardar mucho tiempo, o el sistema de correos no sirven para un apuro. mSpy brinda un acceso completo de asistencia técnica las 24 horas del día, todos lo días. Se puede contactar por email, una ventana de chat e incluso un número telefónico gratuito. También brinda la opción de comprar un paquete llamado mAssistance por 43 dólares adicionales, a cambio del acceso a un asistente personal para solucionar cualquier tipo de problema técnico. Este asistente proporciona ayuda para realizar un jailbreak, instalar el software, navegar por el panel de control, o cualquier ayuda que sea necesaria. mSpy tiene una amplia gama de funciones. A continuación una detallada lista de ellas: Funciones básicas Funciones especificas mySpy es compatible con los dispositivos más populares, ya sea iOS, Android, Windows o Mac. Prácticamente la aplicación no recibió quejas respecto a su compatibilidad, por lo que se considera una aplicación universal. Salvo que el dispositivo que se quiera usar sea muy viejo y haya quedado obsoleto, no se presentarán inconvenientes. Los requisitos mínimos para ser compatible son:  mSpy es una de las aplicaciones más fáciles de instalar, y es muy amigable para el usuario. En unos 15 minutos se puede llevar a cabo todo el proceso de instalación y comenzar a monitorear un celular. Sin embargo, en ciertos dispositivos puede tardar un poco mas, como por ejemplo iPhone. Pasos para el uso Los pasos para instalar la aplicación son simples: mSpy ofrece uno de los paquetes más flexibles, tanto en precio como en tiempo. La licencia puede adquirirse por un mes, tres meses o doce meses. Cuanto más larga sea la licencia abonada, más barato resultará el paquete, en relación al precio por mes. La aplicación ofrece la posibilidad de descargar mSpy gratis y realizar una prueba gratuita, la cual dura siete días. Por una semana, se pueden probar todas las funciones de mSpy gratis full.  mSpy se puede comprar en forma de dos versiones diferentes en su sitio web oficial – Versión Básica y Versión Premium. La Versión Básica también está disponible para computadoras de escritorio y portátiles. Como es de esperar, la Versión Premium se llama así porque ofrece más funciones. A continuación, ilustraremos más claramente la diferencia entre estas dos versiones y sus características correspondientes. A continuación, se presenta un resumen rápido de todas las características principales que ofrece mSpy Premium. Esta función mSpy le permite grabar y cargar todos los datos de ubicación GPS del dispositivo objetivo. Esto implica que puede estar constantemente actualizado sobre el paradero del dispositivo de destino, a todas horas. Es una característica asombrosa para empleadores y padres preocupados. Cada correo electrónico recibido y enviado desde el teléfono móvil objetivo se graba y se carga en el servidor mSpy. Esta característica lo ayuda a monitorear toda la actividad de correo electrónico que ocurre en el dispositivo de destino, cubriendo múltiples clientes, incluido Gmail. mSpy mantiene un registro exhaustivo de cada llamada telefónica realizada y recibida en el dispositivo de destino. La información registrada incluye los nombres de contacto, números de teléfono y las duraciones, horas y fechas correspondientes de las llamadas. El software registra los detalles, así como el contenido de cada mensaje de texto recibido y enviado desde el dispositivo de destino. Tenga en cuenta que esta información se obtiene incluso si los mensajes se han eliminado del dispositivo de destino. mSpy lo ayuda a recopilar detalles sobre las conexiones Wi-Fi a las que se conecta el dispositivo de destino, e incluso le brinda la capacidad de administrar dichas conexiones. También tiene la capacidad de ver todos los videos y fotos almacenados en el dispositivo de destino. Usando esta función de mSpy, puede aprender sobre cada pulsación de tecla escrita en el dispositivo de destino. Todas las pulsaciones de teclas se graban y cargan constantemente en el servidor de mSpy. Esta grabación es posible para todos los dispositivos móviles Android, iPhones, computadoras Mac y computadoras Windows. Los usuarios de mSpy también tienen la capacidad de bloquear el dispositivo objetivo o incluso limpiarlo completamente desde una ubicación remota, en caso de que el dispositivo haya sido robado o perdido. mSpy le permite ver todos los detalles de contacto en el dispositivo de destino, así como monitorear cada actividad de calendario realizada en este. Esta información puede ser muy útil para los usuarios corporativos, ya que pueden mantenerse actualizados sobre los horarios y las reuniones de sus empleados. Con la mayoría de las interacciones en línea que ocurren en los sistemas de mensajería instantánea en la actualidad, esta característica ha demostrado ser extremadamente útil para todos los usuarios de mSpy. Al usarlo, puede grabar y monitorear constantemente los mensajes recibidos y enviados desde el dispositivo de destino, a través de servicios de mensajería instantánea. Las aplicaciones de mensajería instantánea cubiertas por esta función incluyen WhatsApp, Viber, Hangouts de Google, Skype, Snapchat, LINE, Tinder, Telegram, Facebook Messenger e iMessage. Tenga en cuenta que, aunque mSpy solo se puede usar en un solo dispositivo a la vez, siempre es posible cambiar el dispositivo de destino tantas veces como desee. Incluso puede monitorear el dispositivo de destino en función de palabras clave específicas y recibir notificaciones cada vez que el usuario de destino haya escrito una palabra clave específica. Esta alerta de palabra clave se puede aplicar a todos los medios de comunicación utilizados en ese dispositivo. Los padres interesados pueden bloquear las llamadas entrantes de números de teléfono específicos, para mantener a sus hijos alejados del peligro. Esto se puede lograr a través de la pestaña de administración de dispositivos en el Panel de Control de mSpy. También puede bloquear el acceso del usuario objetivo a ciertos sitios web o aplicaciones que considere potencialmente dañinos. Nuevamente, esta es una característica muy útil para los padres preocupados que no quieren que sus hijos visiten sitios web inapropiados o usen aplicaciones peligrosas. Como también se destacó anteriormente, tan pronto como se instala mSpy en el dispositivo de destino, se ejecuta en modo completamente invisible y sigiloso, en segundo plano. El usuario objetivo nunca recibirá ni siquiera una pequeña pista de que está siendo monitoreado. El software mSpy mantiene un registro completo de cada actividad de Internet que ocurre en el dispositivo objetivo, cubriendo historiales de búsqueda, marcadores e historiales web. Recibirá una actualización instantánea cada vez que el usuario del teléfono objetivo cambie su tarjeta SIM. Al usar esta función mSpy, puede crear un área virtual y recibir notificaciones instantáneas cada vez que el dispositivo de destino se saca de ese borde predeterminado. mSpy app es la mejor aplicación de espionaje disponible en el mercado. Su practicidad y diseño innovador pensando siempre en la conveniencia del usuario medio junto a la solidez de sus características lo convierten en la opción más fuerte en el mercado actual. mSpy es sinónimo de calidad dentro de las aplicaciones de espionaje y obtendrá sin ninguna duda los resultados esperados.

        "body": " Due to the quality and good reputation of the app, mSpy is the trustworthy market leader, with only FlexiSPY as their main competitor. Though both apps offer similar functions, mSpy has the edge when it comes to pricing. In this review, we will discuss which functions mSpy offers and what their pricing schemes are. Download mSpy The mSpy app has versions to monitor almost any modern device. The service started as simple mobile phone monitoring software in 2011. But with the development of current tablets and smartphones, newer versions and updates of the app offered an ever-increasing list of services. The software has been adapted to monitor almost any internet-enabled device. They have versions for Android smartphone or tablet, iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. You will also find computer monitoring versions for both Windows PCs and Apple Macs. Depending on which target device you wish to track, you will need to buy a different version of the software. Since operating systems get frequent updates, you should visit their website for the latest versions available. They also provide a handy list of all the makes and models supported. Keep in mind that the release of the software you should choose depends not on the model you have but preferably on the model you wish to track.  This feature is popular with parents and employers alike. Geofencing allows you to set up certain restricted areas using Google Maps. As soon as the device enters one of the restricted areas, you will get an alert. You can choose to receive an email any time this happens, or it can show up as an alert on the Online Dashboard. Of course, this service also comes with a log of all of the devices’ locations, which can be set for any desired period. mSpy’s Geofencing is one of the software’s main functions and one of the reasons the app has become so popular. The folks at mSpy are working hard every day to monitor every new messenger or social media app that is launched. It is especially crucial for younger users who are prone to download and experiment with different apps for communication. Of course, no monitoring solution would be complete without the ability to monitor communication apps. If a mobile spy app does not monitor your child’s or employee’s social apps, is there even a point in having one at all? Right now, mSpy keeps track of all messages from WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, SnapChat, Viber, Skype, Line, Telegram, iMessage, Instagram, and Twitter. Tinder is another app that was just added, and mSpy is one of the only apps that can monitor both Tinder and Snapchat! It allows you to not only read the contents of each message but see all shared images and videos as well. mSpy monitoring service for messenger and social media apps is the most powerful on the market.  It is one way to keep your child away from undesirable friends, or even trolls and stalkers. Certain apps, such as Tinder, are not for children to use. And you would not want your employees casually flirting with your company phone. The app allows you to block any undesirable app on your target device. Additionally, you can pause or delete apps that are already installed. It adds another layer of security. With the mSpy app, you can block access to any list of websites you choose. You can block certain websites completely, or choose only to allow them during certain time slots. It is a way to keep your employees from wasting valuable company time on entertainment websites or to keep your children focused when they should be doing their homework. You can also block specific categories, such as adult content completely. You can even go so far as to prevent the internet entirely. The Keylogger is another feature exclusive to mSpy. It will let you see everything that is typed on the device, from emails, text messages, to URLs, logins, and more. This feature is only available for parental control for Android for now, but it is expected to become available for Apple devices as well soon. Using public Wi-Fi on business devices can prove to be a threat. Especially, if said devices contain sensitive and valuable information, such as bank details, logins, and other passwords. With mSpy’s Wi-Fi monitoring, you can monitor every Wi-Fi connection the target device makes. The app will show you a list with every connection ever made, and it gives you the option to restrict access to public hotspots remotely. Other security features include phone locking, data wiping, and SIM change notifications. Thanks to these features, mSpy can boast a complete offer when it comes to parental controls and mobile spy software. If you wish to track an Apple device that has not had a jailbreak, there is no need to perform a jailbreak. It is a relatively new development, and it is available for all Apple products, including iPhones, iPads, etc. This type of software works slightly differently from the rest of the mSpy software. In the case of no jailbreak monitoring, no software needs to be downloaded on the target device. Instead, you need to use the device’s Apple ID and password. The device must be set up to use Apple’s automatic backup service. If set up correctly, no notifications will be sent to the device or the iCloud. Sign in to iCloud using the password of the device and allow mSpy access. mSpy will then display reports in your mSpy Online Dashboard. The software will enable you to see: When it comes to a messenger or social media monitoring, the options are fewer than the regular versions. Though, you can still monitor Skype, WhatsApp, Line, and other messenger services. No Jailbreak monitoring has some limitations compared to routine monitoring, but if jailbreaking is not an option, this is your best choice. mSpy has several features that will make it very easy for you to monitor your target device. You can log in anywhere to receive reports. Alternatively, you can choose to have them uploaded as soon as you have a Wi-Fi connection, and you can pause reporting at any time. That way, your target device will not have to use too much data to upload. While location reports use a relatively small amount of data, if you choose to monitor images and videos, it will use a lot more. You can set time intervals for reporting or choose for real-time reports. It all depends on your needs. The software will update automatically, and there is no need to access the target device once the software been installed. The software is very flexible, whether you are monitoring one device or dozens of them. It makes it a perfect tool, both for parents wishing to monitor their children and for small to medium-sized businesses that need to control their employee’s devices.  The Basic version comes with the following features: The Premium version has even more advanced features, including social media and messenger app monitoring. It also includes access to Wi-Fi networks, the ability to block apps and websites, incoming call blocking and geofencing. The mSpy Basic package is only available for 1 month or more and costs $29.99. We recommend that if you simply wish to test the software. The Premium package will actually give you much better value for money, especially if you choose the one-year package. In that case, mSpy will only cost you the equivalent of $16.67 per month. A small price to pay for peace of mind. mSpy also has a refund policy, though this is somewhat limited. It applies only for the first subscription and for 14 days only. If you have technical issues with the software in this period, you can get a full refund. However, mSpy does offer considerable support to ensure this will not be necessary. Their team can even help you jailbreak or root a mobile device remotely, to ensure their software will work. If you want to know what mSpy dashboard looks like, head over to their site for a demo. There, you can see what each part of the dashboard looks like, giving yourself a good idea of what you can expect once you have installed the app. mSpy is beating its competitors by offering an all-in-one service for monitoring every aspect of the target device. Thanks to their innovative dashboard, you can get an accessible overview of the device’s activity. You can choose between blocking or simply monitoring.

According to the Common Sense Census, 84% of American teens aging 13-18 had their smartphone in 2019. They spent 7 hours and 22 minutes every day using social media. Even though the Internet gives the chance to free communication and education, youngsters begin interacting with strangers they would never meet in the real world. Regarding e-safety, children can encounter hazards, like sextortion, online harassment, and cyberbullying. Moreover, using social media too much can lead to Internet addiction or diminished social interaction in kids. As a parent, it is crucial to keep close tabs on your kid’s mobile phone activities. According to CellTrackingApps’ review of mSpy, it is one of the best tools to get the job done. They’re on the market for 10 years and have been releasing updates every year to stay ahead of the competition. We’ll go into great depth about the functions, legality and pricing in this review. Table of contents mSpy is a mobile spying app that can be installed on your target device to help you observe its activities remotely. This solution provides information, such as phone calls, instant messengers, social media activities, locations, tracking, and so on. Notably, the app works in the background in a complete incognito mode, which prevents being tracked by the target phone. Being launched in 2010, mSpy has considerably developed to be one of the most prevalent mobile spying apps across the world. It is reliable, simple to set up, and eligible for both Android and iOS mobile devices. Besides, the app gives users a deep analysis of the target cell phone’s activities. All data acquired from the application is uploaded into the company’s cloud server, where you access via the web-based dashboard. You can navigate to the dashboard from a mobile or a computer. mSpy is an excellent solution that covers a lot of uses. Some people utilize it as parental control to keep an eye on their kid’s mobile activities. Meanwhile, others leverage it to make sure their employees use their company phones for business-related matters. After mSpy is installed on the phone, the app runs in the background. That helps the app stay hidden on the target device. After installation, the app can bring you everything on the target phone, such as incoming/outgoing calls, location tracking, social media usage, instant messages, and many more. mSpy gets all this information and includes them to your online dashboard to help you monitor easily. Remember that the app uses an Internet connection (Wi-fi or 3G/4G) to upload the data to the dashboard. Hence, you need to ensure that the target phone is connected to the Internet so that you can have information. You can get some information about the target phone from your dashboard: You also can manage some key function by using your mSpy dashboard remotely: mSpy Full Features! From your control panel, you can decide the default behavior for the target phone. Then the app will work with these settings until you make some changes. You might want to make sure everything is set “auto-update” so that all of the recorded data is automatically uploaded to your control panel. As uploading all of the information on a regular basis can affect the phone’s battery life and data usage, you can show mSpy which sorts of information to send over particular connections. For example, videos are a bit large. You can request the app to only upload videos when the device is on wi-fi instead of a cellular connection. Besides, you can set the update interval for data and location information. The lower the setting, the more often the updates will occur. It’s essential to make a balance that doesn’t affect the battery of the phone too fast. In many cases, it is recommended to update information every 30 minutes and location data every 2 minutes. This feature enables you to see which website the monitored device visits, pages this person has bookmarked. Plus, the app can inform you when specific keywords are searched in the browser. This function can help parents to keep tabs on the content their children are watching. Additionally, if the target phone uses Chrome, Safari, or the native Android browser, you can block some websites. You can know all incoming and outgoing calls from the target device within your control panel. You can check call times, duration, names (if any), and the total number of calls. In case the user of the phone removed their call log, you still get its history. That sounds amazing! Moreover, you can decide incoming call blocking for some certain contacts or numbers and block all incoming calls in a specific time period. For instance, you don’t want your son making calls from 11 pm-7 am, you can configure this in your dashboard. mSpy supports tracking all incoming and outgoing text messages from the monitored phone. Phone numbers, the time, and text messages will be shown in your dashboard. Like the case of the call log, you even can view the text messages that have been deleted on the target device. With mSpy, all incoming and outgoing email messages will be displayed in a log file on the dashboard. You can know the email address of the sender/receiver, the email’s timestamp, and content. Like the call log and SMS text log, you still view all the data even if the target user clears emails. mSpy helps you see names, phone numbers, email addresses, and physical address information. Plus, you can read the calendar and schedule of the target mobile. This enables you to view scheduled meetings, all calendar entries, and any scheduled tasks. GPS tracking is one of the most powerful features of mSpy. If you use this built-in GPS system, you can immediately track a phone’s location within 20 meters. Furthermore, you can get a map of their location over a specific amount of time. You also can monitor the phone by using wi-fi if it cannot receive GPS signals. The GEO fencing feature allows you to set up limited zones for the target cell phone. The number of zones you can set up is limitless. The device will automatically record the time and frequency of every zone being visited. What’s more, you can get the phone to give you an email notification that shows you when particular zones have been entered and exited. Parents can take advantage of this feature to protect their children from far away. They can set a “safe zone” around their house, their child’s school, and other destinations they often visit. If the child leaves one of these zones, the parents can receive a notification instantly. There are numerous ways to communicate from a smartphone by using a wide range of social media apps. It’s not enough for you to track text messages only. mSpy helps you to spy some popular social apps, including Skype, Whatsapp, iMessage, Viber, Snapchat, Line, Telegram, Tinder, and Google Hangouts. All of the installed applications on the target device will be shown on your dashboard. You can decide to block or open access to the app. This allows you to make sure that your kids aren’t using any apps that can be harmful to them. The default target keyboard is replaced by a mSpy keyboard that monitors all keystrokes. You can choose the Force Keyboard button in your control panel to ask mSpy to load its keyboard all the time. This feature is great for tracking specific language usage or logging usernames and passwords to sites. Would it be helpful for you to receive a notification whenever a particular word or phrase is used on the target device? Sex, drug, porn, alcohol, or any other keyword can be defined to enable an instant notification to you. What you need to do is to enter all of the keywords you want to track. mSpy will search through apps, text messages, browsing history to alert you of the keyword. mSpy supports a variety of mobile devices, including: mSpy was created to help parents to protect their children and help employers keep their workers productive.

There is only a basic pricing option available. Besides, the Computer Family Kit allows monitoring of three computers. mSpy Full Pricing The installation process is a bit different depending on which device you will monitor and which pricing package you pay for. If the monitored device is an iPhone and you want to jailbreak it, you can consider choosing mSpy Without Jailbreak. It requires the user’s iCloud credentials to implement the installation. Log into your control panel. Select the installation option that matches your device. Then follow the instructions carefully. You should ensure that the iPhone backup is turned on. Backup information to the cloud one time daily, but they must be connected to wi-fi, plugged in, and secured. To check that backups are enabled, navigate to the Configuration menu of the phone, then see whether iCloud Backup is turned on. Then go to Backup and choose Save Now. If the target device doesn’t have a jailbreak feature, you will need the app variant called “No-JailBreak”. Go to Settings > General > About > Version to test the iOS update on the target phone. If the handset has been jailbroken, you can navigate to your dashboard control panel and choose iPhone to continue the update. It takes about 30 minutes to finish jailbreaking the phone and downloading the app. If you don’t know how to jailbreak, you can pay for mSpy to manage the whole process. If you want to install a mSpy Android app, you will have to have physical access to the phone. Choose “Android” from the control panel and follow the instructions step by step.

        "body": "SCAM REPORT JANUARY 14, 2013  In the ten years that we have been in the SpyPhone business, we’ve often reached out to our customers to hear what they have to say. Our Trade Up To FlexiSPY promotion is one of those programs. We’d like to share what we found with you and possibly cheer up some very unhappy people at the same time. The purpose of the promotion – where we offer a discount equal to the remainder of your license on a competitors spy product – was to talk to the ex customers of our competitors, and discover how we compared against our rivals. One result stood out like a giant at a Hobbits birthday party – the greatest number of trade ins were from mSpy customers. This over representation was intriguing, and begged the question, “is mSpy a scam,” or was there another reason for mSpy customers being so unhappy. To be sure that the results were not skewed, we decided to carry out more research. We looked through several hundreds of pages of review sites such as the BBB, ResellerRatings and RipoffReport and categorized the complaints to see if there was a pattern. We then summarized and collated the information which produced the graphs below.   1. mSpy does not work properly Many mSpy customers complain that the IM capture or call recording did not work as advertised. 2. mSpy wouldn’t refund my money The mSpy 10 day refund policy has many hidden conditions. They do not want to refund you. 3. mSpy customer support didn’t help me mSpy customer support will ask you to reinstall the software to fix all issues. They will also give generic answers to your questions. Let’s be clear, we are not saying that mspy is a scam, and we encourage all mspy customers to try to resolve their dispute with mspy directly, but if that doesn’t work out, we are here to help pick up the pieces, including the chance for mspy customers to recover their financial losses.           mSpy vs FlexiSPY Review ClevGuard vs FlexiSPY Review XNSPY vs FlexiSPY Review Highster Mobile vs FlexiSPY Review iKeyMonitor vs FlexiSPY Review Spyzie vs FlexiSPY Review"

How My Worries Began – The problem I had was couldn’t always work out whereabouts my drivers where or what they were doing. They could have been in a bar having a drink for all I knew (luckily none of them were!). You probably have a different problem, like needing to know where your children are and what they are doing… Basically all these problems have the one solution – install cell phone spying software.   And so that’s when my search began – First of all I searched for weeks for a free downloadable cell Spy Software that I could install. I did find one but unfortunately it was packed with viruses and didn’t work properly – it kept on trying to access my computer files. The worst part of all was the downloaded cell spy only worked on and off and the data wasn’t at all accurate. You obviously cannot question anyone about what you have found out if the data isn’t reliable. My warning is don’t download spy software FREE as it probably won’t work and you might be plagued by viruses and other computer issues. The conclusion – don’t waste time messing around, just get one that works straight away. “Mspy Is A fantastic Mobile Spy Software Download, It Has Helped Me Keep A Track Of Employees. Running my Business Would Now Be Vry Tough For Me Without Mspy.” “If you like this page, could you quickly help us out by sharing this page?

        "body": "Most teens have their own phones these days. But do you really know what yours are doing while they’re on their devices? If you’re like most parents, probably not, which is why so many have installed the mSpy Mobile Phone Tracker. And right now is a great time to get it since a lifetime subscription is discounted for a very limited time to only $99.99 during our Pre-Black Friday Doorbuster Sale. The mSpy mobile phone tracker is an Android and iOS compatible app that monitors phone usage. It’ll let you see call logs, web history, text messages, social media activity, and more. Best of all, the phone’s user won’t even know that it’s there. It runs quietly in the background of the installed device, so it won’t even be visible. And the data it logs is encrypted too, so there’s no chance that it’ll ever be discovered.  You probably got your kids a phone to keep them safe. But, sadly, the web is crawling with people who don’t have your kids’ best interest at heart. And that’s what makes mSpy a must purchase. And especially today since you can subscribe for way less than you otherwise could, no coupon code is required. Prices subject to change.

I read the website carefully... To whom it may concern It is ironic that when you purchase the product from Mspy there is no outline stating what there refund policy is only when you request a refund they send you a full policy which looks that under no circumstances you are eligible for a refund. What if you made a mistake what if you changed your mind or for any other reasons should they not give you the option to revise your decision within a certain period then you just get emails stating they decline your refund what is my rights then NONE. HIGLY UNACCEPTABLE 😡 WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS SERVICE THEY ARE TRUE SCAM ARTISTS By clicking Submit you are agreeing to the Complaints Board’s Terms and Conditions I am looking for a tracking app for our child, mSpy was one of the option mentioned on the internet a... I purchased the product on the 15/03/2021. Already on purchase I noticed I wasn't able to access all the features and the updates were not frequent as advertised. It worked for one day and then I got a notice saying it lost connection. I reinstalled the app again and again after one day and infrequent updates I got a message that it has lost connection. The device in question is always online (mobile data or wifi). I have contacted the support chat but they are unhelpful. I have also sent numerous mails to the refund and billing depart with only one response on the day I reinstalled the app saying it shows as working and they won't be refunding. To say I am unhappy with the product and service would be an understatement. I do not want an alternative or a repair I want a full refund as this software does not work. By clicking Submit you are agreeing to the Complaints Board’s Terms and Conditions  Mspy constantly lost connection for me too and don't hold your breath on the refund because they will say no. Terrible company-dishonest-rude-and I hope at some point it affects their business their. Sorry you went through the same thing.  I have purchased an annual premium subscription for an iPhone. The dashboard didn't work from the beginning, while I followed all the installation steps. No data. Called the help desk many times and told me that the dashboard isn't working indeed and that i have to use an itunes alternative called anytrans. This is not the product i have purchased, and it looks like i purchased a license for this anytrance. Anytrance sell itself a cheaper license so i feel deceived. I am trying to get a refund but every time they try to \"sell\"me a new cheap product. I just want my money back which i eligible for according to the conditions. By clicking Submit you are agreeing to the Complaints Board’s Terms and Conditions Well, they insist not to refund and sent me everytime this message. So People please don't purchase anything from MSPY. They deceive you, they make it like it is my fault. They are a rip and don't sell you the product they advertise Dear Customer, Thank you for the feedback! Kindly note that all the information is provided on our website. We explain how it works and what the software can do. Our Customers cannot purchase the software unless they accept our \"Terms and Conditions\" and \"Refund Policy\".

We still offer you to keep your subscription so you could use it later, whenever you are ready. We kindly ask you to re-consider the alternative options from our previous emails. We do hope for your understanding and cooperation at this point. Looking forward to hearing from you! Kind Regards, William Grant I have purchased one year subscription plan of mspy which would help me keep track of my child's activities. The site claimed to track all the records of the activities done on the target phone. After purchasing the plan I didn't find any records when seeked for support I was told that it will not Track the details when the phone is connected through datapack which was no where specified on the website or anywhere while I was purchasing the plan when I raised my concern about the cancellation I was told that they will raise a ticket for the cancellation and the billing team will contact me, I have waited for more than 2 weeks and dropped several mails and raised tickets after which I got a reply asking me to compromise with 40% refund which I denied and dropped lots of mail and yet again they are not responding By clicking Submit you are agreeing to the Complaints Board’s Terms and Conditions I paid for Myspy (a year up front) which was installed on my partners phone. Within 24 hours (whilst hexwas at work the next morning) he noticed his phone was running slow and became suspicious. He did a factory reset and this was removed instantly. I am very upset as not only did I pay a lot of money for this I'm still chasing a refund weeks later. I've not been given the service promised to me and feel very let down. This seems to easily detected and too easy to remove from a device. Sarah Bankhead By clicking Submit you are agreeing to the Complaints Board’s Terms and Conditions Their software sucks. Their software is overpriced. Shame on you for your customer service. It's terrible. I... All of those bad reviews terrify me. Is it really that bad? Are there really so many people like me who fell for that? I think everyone would like to refund, but it's absolutely impossible. It's a very sneaky website. They have terms and conditions, they have policies, but they are not shown on the website. Not sure how legitimate is this. Maybe we have to create some kind of a petition and ask all of the people who suffered from mSpy actions to sign it? What do you think? By clicking Submit you are agreeing to the Complaints Board’s Terms and Conditions Why have policies if you don't follow them anyway? This company has unethical practices and one day it will... I have installed mSpy on my phone and it seemed to work fine, but later it just stopped working. I decided to reinstall the app and it actually helped. Again, worked for a few hour and crashed. I've tried the same method 4 times and gave up. Then I went to mSpy official web page (www.mspy.com) and emailed custom service with no luck getting a response. I needed some advice but they ignored me when I needed their help. Such a poor service. By clicking Submit you are agreeing to the Complaints Board’s Terms and Conditions People, stay away from the company www.mspy.com. I thought that the company was professional and great, but... I downloaded app from the website www.mspy.com. I paid large sum for this piece of crap. I downloaded it, but nothing worked. I tried to ask for the help form the moderators, but they ignored my emails and calls. They need only your money and they didn’t car about their customers.

Under the Locations tab, click on Map View to track the real-time location. On the left, there is also a Locations List Tab. Here, you will see the locations where your kids have been. With the geo-fencing feature of MSpy, you can easily safe set boundaries. If your child goes beyond the set boundaries, you will receive an instant notification. Click on Add New Fence to input new location. You can list allowed and forbidden locations. When your child is on a location under the forbidden category, you will receive an instant alert.

Under Call Logs, you can see the type of the call, name of the contact, call duration, and call time. Whatsapp monitoring One of the very cool and surprising monitoring capabilities of MSpy, is the ability to monitor all the WhatsApp information your kids have on their phone, including date, time, duration of every call and text messages sent and received. Parents can access all tracked data directly from the Control Panel at any time, which we must say we really liked. Browser History Want to know what websites kids are checking out?

As your kids watch more and more Youtube, it is very important to be able to monitor what content they are exposed to. Youtube parenatl control features allow you to restrict certain content to some degree . That said, YouTube does includes a lot of violent and rated materials that are not ideal for the young ones. Steps to monitor Youtube content: Note, the safest way to protect children is by regular web security discussions and clarification about what content is okay to watch. MSpy is best used with mobile devices, it supports mobile smartphones running Android 4.0+. Jailbroken iOS users need to run iOS 7-8.4; 9.0-9.1. All non-jailbroken iOS apps are Jailbreak mSpy compliant, no matter which version of the iOS they run. Unfortunately, mSpy is not Windows-phone compliant. When you want to double-check the reliability of your system, you can enter your system form into the mSpy website and get instant guidance on whether or not you should use mSpy. 1. mSpy with jailbreak with supported features Compatible with iOS 7–9.1 To run mSpy, the mSpy iPhone or iPad must be wired to the Internet. The tracking system must be jailbroken.   2. mSpy without jailbreak Compatible for all iOS releases The device needs to be Internet-enabled If you already have the iCloud credentials (Apple ID & Password), you do not need to have physical access to the device. Physical access is needed if iCloud backup on a controlled system is not enabled or if 2-factor/2-step authentication is disabled. The target device must have Android 4.0 +, and must be connected to an Internet connection. Downloading mSpy physically on the target device is necessary. To track instant messages on rooted Androids, one needs to have physical access to the target device. There are some things you need to know first if you're a teenager's parent and you're thinking of downloading a tracking app on your kid’s phone. How exactly do monitoring apps work? Are there any drawbacks? What are the limitations one might have to face? Take a look at this mSpy review to know more about one of the best spy apps in the market. The spy app market is flooded with softwares that all offer impeccable technology. It can be challenging to compare them to choose the right one. Not to mention one that shouldn’t fail in the first place. mSpy monitoring software has created a name in the industry thanks to its easy-to-use features and credibility. MSpy provides parents the resources to track their children against the risks of cyber abuse and child abusers. Thirty-six percent of mobile owners use text services, and 89% of teenagers use social media. Facebook alone has 1.47 billion active users per day, and there is a high probability of scammers, prying eyes, or violent men. While messaging apps are designed to communicate with friends easily and conveniently, this also results in cyberbullying, contact with online criminals, and theft of personal data. The mySpy software helps parents to learn who their children are in touch with and what photos they are sending and receiving on third party chat applications. The tools mSpy offers can help parents recognize threats and abusers online much easier. Cyberbullying happens more and more on common instant messaging sites and can contribute to financial, behavioral, and academic issues. MSpy will help parents keep their children safe online. Other features include access to the device's calendar, emails, contact list, etc. Installing mSpy requires physical access to the target device. You can watch and track their phone remotely once it's enabled, no matter where you are. Read the steps: The mSpy Control Panel helps you to keep track of data that can be accessed at any time, everywhere. You can see the device's location and the most common contacts. The Control Panel also helps you to control several devices at the same time and limit access to others. mSpy also includes information about the device itself, in addition to the device operations. You can find information about the operating system, accessible memory space, and model handset. You can check the device's battery status and whether it is connected to the internet via cellular or Wi-Fi. Information can also be viewed on the network operator of the unit. With mSpy, you can see the latest update of the app, the last time the handset has been synced to the server, and whether the target computer is rooted or jailbroken. You can also see the Support feature of the Control Panel. Different devices have different methods. This mSpy review lays out all of them for you; Jailbreak Many of the older iPhones have not yet received a jailbreak feature. If that is the case for your target device, you would need to use the app variant named “No-Jailbreak.” Please go to Settings->General->About->Version to test the iOS update on the target device. If the handset has been successfully jailbroken, you can go to your dashboard control panel and click “iPhone” to continue the update. The whole process of jailbreaking the phone and downloading the app can be expected to take about 30 minutes or so. When you're not tech-savvy or are not confident jailbreaking the handset or managing the update, mSpy will take an extra charge to manage the entire process. No Jailbreak You should use the mSpy Jailbreak version if the system you want to track is an iPhone, and you don't want to manually jailbreak it. To continue with the update, you will require the user's iCloud credentials. Sign in to your Control Panel to continue. Select the configuration option that suits your equipment. Then obey the instructions, step by step. Make sure the backup is available on the target iPhone. Backup information to the cloud once a day, but they have to be wired to Wi-Fi, plugged in, and secured. To test that backups are activated, go to the Configuration menu of the phone, then make sure “iCloud Backup” is set to “On.” Then go to “Backup”, and press Save Now. For the installation of a mSpy Android app, you will need to have physical access to the phone. From your control panel, select “Android.” Then follow the step-by-step installation instructions. Androids do NOT require rooting for the basic functionality of the app, but the enhanced functionality of monitoring Whatsapp, Viber, Facebook, Skype, Line, Snapchat, and Gmail will require the device to be rooted. You will be able to use either 24/7 email support (basic package) or 24/7 chat and email support (premium and no-jailbreak packages) as paying customers. Their customer assistance staff will deal with any problems that occur during software installation or use. You should receive an email response in less than 30 minutes. Chat processing times are significantly shorter, not more than 2 minutes at times. There are several different mSpy packages available. These vary from the “Basic” package to the “Premium” for phones that have been rooted or require a jailbreak. Also, there is a no-jailbreak kit that has a more straightforward download but does not provide as many features. Below is a description of each schedule, its cost, and its characteristics. As you will see, there are considerable expense savings to spend either quarterly or yearly. Phone If you want to install MSpy in a mobile device, you can choose from three basic subscriptions: For the premium subscription, here are the prices, which is also the same if the device does not require jailbreaking: Computer If you will install the app in computers, the functions are limited compared to mobile devices. There is only a basic package available. Lastly, for the Computer Family Kit, which includes monitoring of three computers, here are the prices: Everything has its merits and demerits, let's find out about the advantages and disadvantages of mSpy through this mSpy review: PROS   CONS   With the high demand for phone spy apps, there are many products that promise to deliver impeccable technology. Trying to compare them and pick the best one to match your needs may be difficult. Not to mention one that originally shouldn't crash. Due to its easy-to-use apps and its reputation, mSpy has built a name in the industry. However, it is important to know the waters or test them a little: Spyzie Thanks to its tracking choices, this app has a leading role in the surveillance industry. The Spyzie app which we have reviewed in the past also offers a free trial version and many more features. Click here to read the full Spyzie review. Recent updates of Spyzie have improved features for social media surveillance, and it also provides activity detection for most large social media sites. They've also introduced location tracking features, including geofencing and warnings. mSpy's goal is to incorporate technologies in the daily life of parents to understand the online behavior of children and to identify signs of cyberbullying and to protect children. mSpy has tools to help identify cyberbullying: Tracking Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Viber, Line, Telegram to spot abusive messages Keylogger and Keywords warnings require all keyboard strokes to be seen on a child's computer. For example, “# roastme” is a recent cyberbullying phenomenon. Such terms can be monitored remotely. The keylogger feature allows you to set up specific words on a target device that you want to identify. mSpy aids in blocking websites, plugins, applications, phone book contacts, because bullies often use sites like Ask.fm, applications like Snapchat to threaten a child. Parents can keep an eye on the address list and block or delete contacts as well. HoverWatch Hoverwatch is a program that can be used for spying on WhatsApp, Snapchat, and Instagram. To update and start using the Mobile App, you need to register your account. Users are expected to add their email address for proper identification. It does not provide location monitoring, geo-fencing, or access to the messages and calls in the target device. Why do we think mSpy is better?   FlexiSpy FlexiSPY uses several features for parental control. After being enabled in the target device, FlexiSPY will capture and send all operation logs to the personal Control Panel. FlexiSPY is not an inexpensive device. They claim to have a comprehensive collection of surveillance features for a high-quality product. However, it is still costly when it comes to the quality of the program. FlexiSPY is not an ideal app for espionage. It provides some pretty helpful features, but they are not cost-effective applications. There is no free trial duration as well, like mSpy free trial pack. mSpy is one of those programs that you should go with if you need a vast range of features at reasonable prices. As a parental control app, it includes unique capabilities along with a user-friendly interface and three payment options. With four tiers of technology support, it is okay if you are not tech-savvy and need help with mSpy installation. mSpy’s professional help will provide you with comprehensive instructions. Monitoring softwares deal with sensible and private information. When you are in the market, looking for a tracking software, you enter a somewhat gray area. It is important to use secure software that is both reliable and trustworthy. When it comes to mSpy apps, it is fair to ask questions like– Is mSpy legit? How does it work? Is it safe to use it? mSpy offers a range of features and monitors discreetly in the background of target devices. After testing the program and looking at mSpy reviews online, it is safe to say that mSpy does work as advertised. You don't want to get robbed on your order if you use this sort of technology. You want as many monitoring apps as possible. You want a good price for precise and safe monitoring. Both these services are provided by mSpy, so it's easy to recommend to someone looking for a phone monitoring solution.   Try mSpy For Free! It is quite easy to uninstall mSpy. You can simply open the “Installed” app for iOS devices, click “iPhoneInternalService,” click “Modify,” and then click the “Remove” option. Go to the “Mobile Settings,” > Security > System Admins > Disable/Deactivate, Get Back to Settings> Applications >Update Software>Uninstall for Android devices. Overall, mSpy is one of the best monitoring apps for mobile devices in the market. It is great for both domestic and technical use and provides a wide variety of features. The multitude of choices helps you to determine which plan and budget are better according to your needs. There are hundreds of devices on the market for phone tracking, but only a handful have the best mix between functionality and quality to make them worth considering. mSpy is one such monitoring app. mSpy is easy to install, customize, and use, and it allows you to view practically everything on your target device. MSpy also provides 24/7 customer support. Nearly all mSpy reviews note exactly how fantastic their professional customer service is. The support staff of mSpy is competent and supportive as they are willing to manage the whole installation process for you, including jailbreaking and rooting. mSpy has proved itself to be an incredibly trustworthy service. It manages flexibility by putting mechanisms in place so that employees and kids are not made aware that they are being watched. As such, there are legal requirements that must be addressed, so use the software ethically and remain safe.   How Does MSpy Work – a very interesting interview with Mspy CMO The last thing you'll want is a failed app that doesn't meet your requirements after paying a hefty amount for it. After this mSpy review, there is not a single doubt that it is a leading spy software with high-quality services. The combination of low prices, varied plans, and exceptional features make it a customer favorite.

Think of FlexiSPY as the master craftsman against the low cost counterfeit sweatshop. Since 2006, when we created the world's first spyphone — we continue to design, develop, test, market and support all our own products — nothing is outsourced and everything is done under one roof.

Join over 1600 spy app enthusiasts who have switched over to FlexSPY. mSpy is a mobile monitoring app marketed as a parental control software to help keep your children safe. Once installed on a target device, mSpy records activity logs such as incoming and outgoing calls, SMS, emails, and more. This data is then transferred to your web-based portal at certain time intervals which you designate, with 5 minutes being the minimum. Before we proceed, please note that mSPY's iCloud spy app does not work in most circumstances. And although mSPY offers an iPhone jailbreak package, it offers few features and little value for money. In fact, there is only one company that truly offers Reliable iPhone Monitoring. Usefully, with mSpy you will also be able to restrict certain actions with features such as call blocking, website blocking, and app blocking on Android devices (not available for IOS). Let’s begin by exploring what devices mSpy is compatible with. mSpy is compatible with Android and to a certain extent, iOS devices. After extensive testing, we found mSpy’s iOS product to be lackluster when compared to their features available on Android. Also, mSPY is not compatible with devices that operate on iOS 10 and above which means it will not work on the latest iPhones. Note that you can’t download mSpy from Google Play or App store. The official app is only available on the mSpy site. Although offering the same or similar features to most phone monitoring apps, mSpy positions itself as the go-to product when it comes to parental control software. They offer one package: Premium begins at $69.99 and gives you access to call logs, photos, videos, instant messenger logs, keylogger, as well as call, app, and website blocking. ‍ Your choice of package will depend on your planned budget and specific needs. Are you on a tight budget and only require minimal data into the user’s mobile activity? If so, mSpy Basic might be a decent choice. On the other hand, mSpy Premium can be useful if you want to have restrictive controls over the target device. However, if are you looking for an advanced package which offers real and actionable insights with features such as call recording, live listening, ambient recording, and IM call recording – then there’s no choice but to go with the original spy app. If you are looking to monitor a mobile device without the user’s knowledge, then discretion is of the utmost importance. For this purpose, mSpy does provide a camouflage for its app. Once the installation process is completed you will be prompted to choose whether you’d like mSpy to be hidden or visible. In this case, hidden does not mean mSpy is completely undetectable, but rather disguised as another application on the target device. Find out more below. mSpy offers three levels of technical support: mSpy allows their customers to pay extra for additional support. As advertised on their website and in their portal, the higher the tier of customer service level on your subscription, the higher the priority you will be given. Having learnt from previous mistakes, mSpy now have implemented security protocols such as data encryption and 2FA. According to mSpy, there is no reason to worry that your account info and child’s data being involuntarily disclosed or available elsewhere. Despite assurances, it’s important to be aware of mSpy’s history of data leaks — a cautionary tale regarding parental control apps which can be explored further below. mSpy let’s parents monitor child’s activities such as websites visited, calls, text messages, and GPS locations. Keep tabs on employees and their location while on the clock. Monitor their websites, work schedules, and time spent on company mobile devices. mSpy disguises itself as a ‘Update Service’ app on a target device, this can help you track your spouse’s movement and monitor all phone activity. When it comes to spy apps, to get real value and insight it’s important that the software always remains hidden. And although mSpy is not a ‘true’ spy app and claims to be for parental control only - having children know they are being monitored can be counterproductive to keeping them safe as they can easily find ways to get around surveillance. For example, once informed that they are being tracked, what stops the child or teenager from simply manipulating the data their parents are privy to? Thankfully, mSpy provides the user with the option to either hide the app or make it visible. Initially, after you download mSpy on the target device you will be asked if you want to hide or keep the mSpy icon. If you choose to hide, an icon titled “Update Service” will appear in the phone’s menu, this is in fact the mSpy app. For Android 9 OS and below, this icon will not appear in the app home page nor the phone’s menu. However, note that ‘Update Service’ icon will appear and remain in the applications list under Settings. Meanwhile, mSpy’s development team is currently working on a way to hide the app icon on Android 10 devices. It’s safe to say that regardless of the device model you are looking to monitor, traces of mSpy and its installation are not necessarily concealed, but rather disguised. Furthermore, mSpy’s restrictive features (call blocking, app blocking, website blocking, Wi-Fi blocking) mean that the target device owner will always be aware that they are being monitored. This may not be significant if you are looking to monitor your children openly and have total control and access to the target device. Still, if you are looking for more discrete surveillance, mSpy will prove problematic as these features mean the app is never truly hidden. Here's an overview of how to install mSpy on an Android phone. If you experience any difficulties during installation, mSpy’s customer service is advertised to be on-hand 24/7 to help you with any inquiries. If their ‘free’ customer service proves unhelpful you may want to consider upgrading to mSpy’s ‘paid’ (Support Priority Line) or ‘uber-paid’ (mAssistance) customer service tiers. In our opinion, the best spy apps will provide you with quality technical support free-of-charge as well as a worry-free installation service where for your convenience, a technician will remotely install the software for you. All you’ll have to do is connect the target device to a PC or MAC. As seen from their marketing focus, mSpy frame themselves as being a parental control app, rather than a true spy app. They have a number of restriction-based features such as app, call, and website blocking — but lack features you'd expect to find in a serious spy app — features such as call recording, IM call recording, live-listening, ambient recording, and so on.  And while mSpy make the case for being the choice for parents who want to protect their children, there is a valid argument that says that restriction-features are counterproductive as it's obvious to the child that there's a monitoring app on their phone and so the child simply deletes or disables the app.  If you are looking an app with serious features and depth, FlexiSPY is designed to remain hidden and offers over 74 features compared to mSpy’s 42. Many of which, including GPS Tracking, SMS and IM Chat Monitoring, also work well as parental control mechanisms. mSpy is a good app for giving you the big picture of your child’s mobile and online activities. However, it does not offer real-time protection with the biggest drawback being the delays in data uploads. In the portal, you can set data to be uploaded every 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 minutes and so on. However, after extensive testing we found that most features took at least half an hour to upload despite being on the 5-minute data upload interval setting – while other features such as photo and video capture took several hours to upload. If your child was setting up a meeting up with a stranger via an instant messenger app, the data you receive is not immediate. Meaning that you as a parent really won’t have adequate time to react or prevent any wrongdoing. You will however have the evidence you need to discipline your child, to hand over to law enforcement, or to take any other remedial action required. On the other hand, mSpy’s iOS product offers minimal features (with no advanced features such as call, app, or website blocking), and what little data it does track is only updated once every 24 hours. This is certainly not ideal for preventing or correcting your children’s misbehavior in a timely manner, nor does it help with any imminent threats to their safety. When you pay a premium for a spy app you should be able to expect: 1. Features to work as advertised On paper, mSpy offers an impressive depth of features, however the app is reliable only to the extent that the user merely requires a broad overview of mobile activities over a flexible time-frame. At the time of testing, mSpy’s social media tracking, email tracking, and call blocking were nonfunctional. Upon inquiry, their customer service promised an update which would fix all issues within a few weeks. When it comes to your child safety you should be looking for consistency. Unfortunately, many of mSpy’s most important features will often not work due to error, network provider or phone provider security measures (see mSpy’s iOS product). When this happens, mSpy’s customer service will inform you that the only option is to wait for their team to fix the problem. Often, if they are unable to help you will be offered a complimentary 1-2-week extension to your subscription as a compromise. As a general rule, if you are ever told by a spy app’s customer service that features will work at a later date with an offer to freeze your account until they do, we recommend you request an immediate refund, get a credit card charge-back, or look at trade-in programs for more reliable solutions. 2. An Honest and Reliable Refund Policy mSpy advertises a 10-Day Money-Back Guarantee. However, many people find out almost immediately that partial or full refunds are incredibly hard to get, despite what it says in their marketing material. Read mSpy’s fine print and you’ll see why their airtight refund policy is misleading at best, and downright factitious at worst. Don’t just take our word for it, take a look at some of the comments customers are making on one of mSPY’s top affiliate sites, https://www.mspyreview.net/ Some of the complaints listed on Better Business Bureau also provide revealing insight to mSPY’s refund and other customer service practices. Common refund issues highlighted range from being charged a full amount during a free trial through to being unable to obtain a refund within minutes of purchase (despite strictly adhering to terms of service). Apple’s new security policies have meant that most spy apps no longer offer a viable product for iOS devices that are not jailbroken. For mSpy’s iOS product to track and upload any data the user will be required to deactivate 2FA on the target device. Unfortunately, towards the end of 2019 Apple no longer allows this action, having quietly removed the option in its iOS 10 release. mSpy's customer service informed us that they are currently working on a solution get around Apple’s 2FA policy. And as this would be a gargantuan undertaking, we won’t be holding our breath as we wait for an update to fix this issue. For now, mSpy does offer an alternative solution, the viability of which we leave up to the reader. Create a new iCloud ID The alternative solution offered by mSpy is to simply to create a new iCloud ID for the target device. Apple policy stipulates that within the first two weeks the owner of a newly created iCloud account will still have the choice to activate or deactivate 2FA. Again, if you are openly monitoring younger children this may not be an issue as you would be able to impose on them which account to use. However, if you are monitoring an employee or an older child, this can prove problematic. If you are looking to monitor a non-jailbroken iOS device with mSpy you must not only have control over the user’s current Apple credentials, but also the authority to force them to create a new Apple email for any data to be tracked. To find out more why iCloud Spy Apps are not a viable choice see here. However, if you feel you've learnt enough about mSpy you may want to skip straight to the most reliable iPhone monitoring app on the market here. FlexiSPY and mSPY both offering iPhone jailbreak solutions – however, when compared closely — there’s a clear mismatch with regards to features, compatibility, and reliability. First off, FlexiSPY’s iPhone Spy App has over 50 features, compared to mSpy's jailbroken that has only 8 true features. Furthermore, FlexiSPY is the only solution that can spy on newer iPhones like the iPhone X, 8, 7, 6, 5, & SE. Most competitors, including mSPY, market an iCloud Spy App they refer to as “No-Jailbreak” solution that does not work as advertised. On the other hand, FlexiSPY offers the most reliable iPhone spy app with the most features by far. Keep in mind that FlexiSPY for iPhone, requires you to jailbreak the device have access to reconfigure it as required. With FlexiSPY for iPhone, you’ll get Advanced Features you can’t find anywhere else including IM Call Recording, Spy Call, RemCam, RemVid, Ambient Recording, and more. Given the company’s track record when it comes to data security, the better question to ask is - will my child be more safe, or less safe with mSpy installed on their device? Although mSpy has not been hacked since May of 2018, their history of data leaks should be a clear warning sign for any loving parent. Just imagine purchasing a parental control app with the goal of keeping your child safe, only to end up having their name or private photos leaked to god knows where. Furthermore, mSpy’s track record for responding to breaches doesn’t inspire any confidence. For example, in a previous 2015 leak, hackers stole data from mSpy’s servers and posted it on the deep web. After initially denying the breach, mSpy promised to tighten security. Two weeks later, Krebs Security noted that they still had not removed links to screenshots of mobile devices running mSpy. When it comes to your children, data security is vital. And for an app whose main platform is ‘parental control’ and keeping children safe, mSPY’s record of multiple leaks over the years is quite frankly, appalling. Here is one former customer describing their mSpy experience on Better Business Bureau, Find out more about spy app data leaks and consider all your options before making your decision. To see if mSpy is installed on your phone, simply go to app list, and if you see an icon titled ‘Update Service’ then the device has mSpy installed. Also, for Android 10 Devices, the mSpy icon can be found in the app drawer under the same name, ‘Update Service’. Next let’s look at uninstallation.

A message on inSta False advertising! Product does not work with iPhone. Company difficult to work with and refund refused. Read 1 more review about mSpy It started out great when the target phone was android. I was using it as monitoring software for my teenager. The selling point was the key logging, text logging and most importantly remote access. Website says that it is compatible with any iPhone or android. I recently upgraded the target phone to an iPhone SE, which per the website is compatible. As far as iPhone I was allowed to use only a fraction of the features. I contacted tech support who confirmed that none of my needed features are available for remote access meaning that I would need to get the phone and do a data dump every time. I politely explained that this is the opposite of the advertisement and since the software is no longer doing what it was supposed to I’d like a refund for the balance of my subscription. Their reply is that the limited software abilities are beyond their control and they cannot issue a refund. How is it beyond your control when you advertise all these features on “any iPhone, iPad or android”? They offered to freeze my account so I would still have the time on my subscription but that’s not really useful as I don’t intend on returning my family’s brand new iPhones to get androids in the foreseeable future. I have saved the chat logs with tech support stating that the features do not work. Bottom line if the target phone is android it works just okay. If you have an iPhone or I guess a newer iPhone (2nd gen SE is not that new) don’t expect any of the advertised features. One star for terrible customer service and false advertising.

        "body": " mSpy is probably the most popular monitoring software on the market today. It is designed for parents who want to track their children’s online activity. Using mSpy is easy — just download and install a hidden app on your child’s phone and let it do its thing in the background. mSpy is available for iOS and Android, and has a web-based control panel that allows you to remotely monitor activity on your child’s device, including texts, instant messages, phone calls and social media use on Snapchat or Facebook. It also allows you to track the location of your child’s device on a map. The best thing about mSpy is that it works on non-jailbroken iPhones. Do note that some of its features, including email tracking and instant messenger monitoring, are only available on a rooted Android smartphone. If you don’t know how to root an Android device, you might want to consider using a spy app like Highster Mobile. This app lets you spy on Android phone without rooting. mSpy works by recording the device’s activity and uploading it to your account. To use it, you must first subscribe either monthly or annually to a basic or premium plan. You can cancel your subscription any time. Once you’ve subscribed to mSpy, you should be able to log in to your account. Next, you will need to download and install the mSpy app on their smartphone. The installation instructions will guide you through downloading and installing the software. Once installed, it runs in the background, and becomes invisible to the user, so your children won’t know they are being monitored. mSpy will immediately start monitoring and recording all activities taking place on their device. These activities include GPS locations, phone calls, social media, IM chats, texts, emails, photos, videos, contacts, browsing history, keystrokes and much more. All of this data can be tracked on the mSpy website. If you are experiencing any problems, please don’t hesitate to contact them. The support team is available to help around the clock via live chat, email and phone.  The mSpy monitoring app is currently available on iOS and Android mobile devices, as well as Windows and Mac computers. To find out if your device is compatible, click here: www.mspy.com/compatibility.html Supported operating systems For the purposes of this review, I tested the app for Android. mSpy is designed to be easy to use and set up, even if you’re not a tech savvy person. After purchasing a subscription, you will receive an email containing your username and password.  Once your account has been created, you can log in to the mSpy control panel at https://www.mspyonline.com. When you log in for the first time, you will be taken to the Setup Wizard page as shown below:  Click to select your device, and then click Proceed. It will walk you through the installation process.  I installed the app on a Samsung Galaxy S6 running Android 5.0 for testing. Installation took just a few minutes. Below is a step by step guide on how to install it on an Android phone. Step1 – Enable Unknown Sources This allows you to download apps that are not available on the Google Play Store. To enable unknown sources, press the Menu key from the Home screen and tap Settings. Select Security, then enable Unknown sources by moving the slider to the right.  Step 2 – Download and Install the App The download link can be found in your control panel. Simply type the URL into the phone’s browser to download the app (an APK file). Once the download is complete, you will need to select the .apk file and install it.  Step 3 – Hide the App Icon When installation is complete, open the mSpy app. You will be asked to agree to the license agreement. Tap Accept to continue. The app will then ask who you will be monitoring. Choose employee, child or other. You will be then asked if you want to hide the app icon. Select Icon is useless. I don’t need it and tap Continue.  Step 4 – Root Access (optional) When you start the app for the first time, SU will pop up a dialog asking for root access. Make sure Ask Again is not checked and tap Grant (or Allow) immediately. If this message doesn’t appear, it means that the phone is not rooted. Some features (keylogger, email and instant messengers monitoring) will not be functional.  Step 5 – Enter Registration Code You will be prompted to enter your registration code. This 8-digit code can be found on your control panel which is located on “Step 3” of the online installation guide. Tap the “Complete Registration” button and you’re all set.  You can now log in to the web-based control panel to access data collected from your child’s device such as texts, calls, contacts, and instant messages.  mSpy is a comprehensive monitoring software for parents that’s packed with high-end features at an affordable price. Here are some of my favorite features: 1. No Jailbreak Required: mSpy was one of the first to offer monitoring software for iPhone without jailbreaking the device. This technique works by extracting data from iCloud backups. You will need to know your child’s iCloud login credentials (Apple ID and password). Here’s a step-by-step tutorial on how to use the no-jailbreak solution.  2. Keylogger: It captures every keystroke made on the target device. If your child uses a social networking app that mSpy can’t track directly, you can still see every keystroke typed. This feature is available on Android, Windows and Mac OS.  3. Device Change: Whether you have a monthly or annual subscription, your subscription can only be used on one device at a time. However, it is possible to deactivate the license on the old device and activate it on the new one. You can move the license as often as you like.  4. Geo-Fencing Feature: Using a map in your control panel, you can mark as many “Allowed” and “Forbidden” areas as you want and get instant alerts every time your kids enter or leave those areas.  5. Upload Settings: This is a good option if you’re on a limited data plan. In your control panel, you can choose to upload activity logs over Wi-Fi, or both Wi-Fi and cellular networks, so you can avoid overage charges.  Best of all, you can try out a free demo on their website before you buy, so give it a try.  mSpy Basic costs $29.99 per month, $59.99 billed every three months, or $99.99 billed annually. mSpy Premium offers three pricing tiers: $69.99 per month, $119.99 every three months, or $199.99 annually. If you’re looking to save money, consider purchasing an annual plan. Family kit plans are offered, allowing you to monitor 3 devices. These plans start at $359.97 for 6 months or $479.97 for 12 months. mSpy also has bundle plans beginning at $84.99 per month that allow you to monitor their phone and computer at the same time, under the same account. You can pay for your subscription using a credit card or PayPal. mSpy does offer a 14-day money back guarantee, but it applies only if the software doesn’t work.  Their technicians are knowledgeable, efficient, friendly, and always ready to help you with any issues or questions you may have. You can reach the technical support team by phone, live chat and email. Not only can you reach support around the clock, but you have your choice of how to contact them. Contact choices are based on the package that you purchase. The Basic Plan includes email support only. With the Premium Plan, you have your choice of email or live chat support. Phone support is available for a fee of $12.99. This service can help you with main feature setup, step by step installation, and general support. The mAssistance installation service is designed to help you install mSpy smoothly and seamlessly. A trained technician will remotely install and configure the software on your child’s device. mAssistance is an optional service that can be purchased for as little as $44. Note that you will still need to have access to their device in order to use this service. mSpy is easy to use and has a user-friendly control panel, which can be accessed using a web browser. The support team offers exceptional service, which will ensure you get the software up and running on the target device. The robust features will ensure all activity is recorded, and ready for you to view. The Keylogger is an exceptional addition, that allows you to see every keystroke entered on the device, even those that are deleted. mSpy is considered one of the best cell phone monitoring software on the market today. I highly recommend giving it a try. Visit mSpy.com » Overall, I am pretty satisfied with the ease of use, customer support, and robust features it has to offer. It is a great application that can help you understand activities that are occurring on a phone. I hope this mSpy review has given you some guidance regarding this monitoring software."

Have you ever heard of activity tracking and device monitoring software or parental control apps? In this age of the internet, it’s not uncommon to come across an online article or two featuring one of these apps.  Although they’re typically marketed as spying apps, these apps can actually do more than just monitor device activities. They can also be set up to block dangerous websites, adult content, prevent unwanted callers, and monitor physical locations.  If you have children, it is even more important to always be on the lookout for their welfare and safety, wherever they may be. Luckily for you, there are many smartphone apps that can help control and monitor activities on mobile devices. Many of these offer the same functions and capabilities as one another, though there are some that shine brighter than others. mSpy phone tracking app is one such app, and it is often claimed to be one of the best mobile tracking tools on the market today. In this comprehensive mSpy review, we’ll discuss all the features of mSpy and whether or not it’s worth purchasing. Contents [hide] mSpy app is a device monitoring software from MTechnology Ltd that can track all activity on your specified smartphone, tablet, or computer. It is also correct to say that it’s a parental control app. The application comes with a web-based dashboard – the Control Panel – which allows you to view everything on your target phone, such as SMS texts, call logs, GPS location, internet browsing history, photos and videos, and even some of the most popular social media apps.  If you’re planning to use the mSpy app to track your family members’ phones, you don’t have to worry about them finding out, as mSpy works very discreetly. You can safely review all the content on the target user phone and scan for any compromising data without their knowledge. There’s a 14-day money-back guarantee for all those who are interested, and there’s also a demo version that potential users can try out on the mSpy website.  mSpy software works by sending data from your target device to your online mSpy Control Panel through Wi-Fi or data. It works quietly in the background, transmitting data without alerting the owner of the phone. Once the app is installed on your preferred device, regardless if it’s a phone, tablet, or computer, it gains access to almost all the data on the phone, such as call logs, location, instant messages, media, and more. All this data is sent to the web-based dashboard for your viewing. However, do keep in mind that for the mSpy app to continuously transmit data, the target device must be connected to the internet at all times. You can install the mSpy app on anyone’s phone, be it your family member’s (such as your children), employee’s, or even your own phone. Do take note that legally speaking, you have to ask for permission first before doing so if you plan to install it on somebody’s else device. Contrary to popular belief, these monitoring apps aren’t just for ‘snooping’ on your target phone. You can also use mSpy to physically monitor your target device’s location at all times.  If you’re an employer, you could have your employees install the mSpy app on their phones so you can see, in one glance, who is where at any time. This also allows you to see if anyone’s making phone calls or chatting online in the middle of the workday.  As with any of other parental control apps, there are a few technical requirements that the target device has to meet before you can install mSpy on your child’s phone or another device. We will talk about them in our mSpy review as well. For Androids, the device must have an OS of at least Android 4+. You’ll also have to root the phone if you want to be able to monitor instant messages like WhatsApp (despite its end-to-end encryption) and Snapchat, which means overriding all limitations to gain full access and control of the device.  Regardless if it’s rooted or not though, the device has to be physically with you to install the mSpy app. For iPhones, the requirements differ if you have a jailbroken device than if you have a non-jailbroken device. First of all, installing the mSpy app on a jailbroken iOS device is a tad more difficult than on a non-jailbroken device. You have to make sure that the device has an iOS version of 7 to 9.1 and that it’s connected to the internet. You also need to have physical access to the device for at least 10 minutes to finish the app installation and setup. On the upside, jailbroken iOS devices with mSpy installed have more available parental control features than non-jailbroken devices. Features such as social media monitoring, geo fencing, email access, call recording, and web blocking, for instance, are only available on jailbroken devices. If you don’t want to jailbreak your iPhone, then no worries. In fact, installing the mSpy app on a non-jailbroken phone is much easier. You only need the owner’s iCloud details to install mSpy, provided that they don’t have two-factor authentication enabled.  If they do have it though, you’re still going to need physical access to the device. Plus, as mentioned above, doing it this way comes with plenty of limitations. In addition to this, Apple’s new security updates have added further limitations to mSpy’s features. According to mSpy’s support team, features for the latest versions of iOS may be limited to GPS, contacts, geo-fencing, and a Panic button. If you don’t need something so complex, you can also try the mSpy alternative, mLite. This is mSpy’s partner app, which you can use to access your child’s locations, contacts, and other basic features.  Simply install the mLite app on both iPhones and sign-in on the monitoring device using your mSpy login details. After that, follow the on-screen instructions to know what to do on the device you want to monitor.  mSpy app has plenty of features that anyone will want in a monitoring app. In this section, we’ll talk about these features in more detail. One of the biggest selling points of this parental control app for both parents and employers alike is GPS tracking. With GPS tracking, you’ll be able to locate your target device’s current location, no matter where they are in the world. As long as the device is connected to the internet, you’ll be able to see its location at all times. This feature also comes with an important option – to set up restricted areas with Google Maps. If the target phone user enters a restricted area, you’ll receive an email alert or an online notification about the breach. Setting this up is incredibly easy, which makes it one of the most helpful features of mSpy.  mSpy app also allows users to log phone calls on the target device. You won’t be able to listen in to the call exactly, but you can find all the details about all the incoming and outgoing calls. This includes the identity of the caller, what time the call was placed, and how long the call lasted, in addition to other details.  So, if you’re interested to know who your child has been talking to on the phone until the wee hours of the morning, you’ll know your answer instantly by installing mSpy on their phone. Another thing you can do on the mSpy app is to block all unwanted callers and all the incoming calls from them on the target device. This is especially important for parents who are concerned that their children may be talking to people that they shouldn’t be. The full list of contacts, including call logs, will be completely visible to you on your Control Panel dashboard. You can set up a block list here in order to prevent suspicious numbers and contacts from trying to call the target phone. Depending on your device, you can also use mSpy to access all messages and emails.  On Apple devices, this feature works even without jailbreaking the phone. For Android devices though, the phone must first be rooted.  One good thing about this feature is that it also allows you to read even previously deleted messages. Even if your child tries to cover their tracks by deleting messages, you’ll still be able to retrieve the said messages through mSpy. The messages include the date, time, and information about the senders or the recipients. Now, there’s no need to be concerned about your child having shady conversations with strangers and other bad influences. You can also access media files on the target device through the Photos tab, an option you’ll see on your online dashboard. Under Photos, there are three subsections that you can click to access photos and videos on the target device.  The first section shows all media taken today, the second section shows all media taken yesterday, and the third section shows all media taken previously. You’ll be able to see all multimedia files that your child sends or receives on the target phone. mSpy app can also monitor and block certain apps from the target phone. The list includes popular social media apps such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, Skype, Viber, Telegram, Snapchat, and Line that can also be a dangerous place for a child. This parental control app can even monitor activity on Tinder, which is helpful for parents who are worried that their child may be getting into online dating. With app monitoring and blocking, users will not only be able to tell when the target phone user is actively using the apps, they will also be able to view messages, call logs, and multimedia files sent and received on these apps. Completely blocking the app is also an option. Parents can use this feature to protect their children from potentially harmful environments online, while employers can use this feature to keep their employees from using distractive social media apps. If you have kids, you’ll know that it can be really difficult to keep track of their online activity. After all, kids are always curious about everything around them, often sticking their noses in places where they shouldn’t. With mSpy, you no longer have to worry about your children going to websites that may be harmful or suspicious. You get access to a list of all their visited websites, including the most visited sites and when each site was last opened.  You’ll be able to view their entire site history and restrict access to websites that you don’t approve of. You can even customize the level of restriction that you want on the target phone. For example, let’s say you want to prevent your employees from wasting time on social media apps, like Twitter and Facebook, during work hours.  You can use mSpy to restrict certain apps during specific time slots, like from 8 am to 5 pm, to prevent any idle activity and increase work productivity throughout the day.  Another feature that mSpy has is the ability to log every single keystroke typed on the target device.  By doing so, users can uncover information like log-in details, usernames, passwords, encrypted text, URLs, messages, and emails. Basically, anything and everything that was typed on the target phone can be seen by the user on the online Control Panel. The best thing about this is that mSpy is the only cellphone spying app on the market right now that can record and save keystrokes. Sadly, this feature is only available on Android devices at the moment, although there are plans to expand it to iOS devices as well. Did you know that public Wi-Fi hotspots can be quite dangerous? The truth is that public hotspots can be a cesspool of viruses, malware, and phishers ready to swoop in and wreak havoc on your device.  This is extremely worrisome for people who keep everything on their phone, including sensitive personal information, like passwords and bank details.  This is even more worrisome for children, who may not even think twice before connecting to any free hotspot that they see when they’re outside. mSpy allows users to monitor and control all Wi-Fi connections that the target phone makes. This means you’ll be able to track the device through Wi-Fi networks, even if it has its mobile data switched off.  You can view all the details of the connection, including the times the device accessed that specific network. You can even block the device from connecting to that Wi-Fi network, in case you don’t deem it safe enough to use. If you’re issuing business devices for work, it also helps to have this feature to prevent any company information from leaking due to an unsafe public Wi-Fi network. This feature is very helpful if the owner happens to lose a monitored phone. With mSpy, you can remotely lock the phone or, if worse comes to worst, even wipe all its data. This is all done in the background, without the holder of the phone knowing what’s happening. With your mSpy plan comes comprehensive reporting, which you can customize to your heart’s content. You can specify which information you want to see in the reports and you can also choose the frequency that you receive them. All mSpy plans also allow single and multiple device installations. However, you can use each individual plan for only one device at a time. If you want to monitor a different device, you have to remove the first device first. The upside is that you can switch out devices you’re monitoring for as many times as possible. Other than this, the biggest selling point of mSpy is likely the fact that it doesn’t require you to root or jailbreak the target device before you can use it, unlike many other tracking and monitoring applications on the market today. That said, keep in mind that you can get more features if you can get root access to the device, but it’s not required to install the app. This is great if you want to be very discreet about using mSpy, especially if you’re planning to install it on your child’s phone.  Our mSpy review would not be complete without this section. mSpy’s customer service department is one of the best out there in the tracking and monitoring app market, and many online reviews can attest to that. For example, here’s one from TheToolReport.com: mSpy supports different languages. You can also use the app in French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, and Turkish. There are two different support tiers, depending on the package that you purchased. If you have the basic package, you’ll only have access to 24/7 email support. If you have the premium and no-jailbreak package, you’ll have access to both 24/7 chat and email support.  Don’t worry though, regardless of your plan, the support team will always try to help you out to the best of their abilities. mSpy’s support team can be reached through a variety of methods, including live chat, email, and phone.  Phone calls depend on the availability of their customer service representatives, but you can usually expect to receive live chat replies instantly or up to a few minutes, and email replies from help@mspy.com in less than 30 minutes, though it can take up to 5 hours as per the company’s customer service representative. Lastly, mSpy also offers a full money-back guarantee, in case you encounter an issue that cannot be resolved by the company’s support center.  Full refunds can be given within 10 days after subscribing to a plan for both mSpy desktop and mSpy for mobile devices, except if the reasons are outside the company’s control as per the refund policy .  There’s no such thing as a perfect product, and mSpy is no exception. Here are all the reasons why you should, or should not, purchase mSpy. The cost of mSpy depends on the plan you purchase. There are two main plans: the Basic Plan and the Premium Plan. The Basic Plan comes with all the regular features that most tracking applications have. This includes call log monitoring and GPS tracking. Prices start at $26.99 for the 1-month plan, $59.99 for the 3-month plan, and $99.99 for the 12-month plan. If you want more advanced features, you can get the Premium Plan. This plan includes social media monitoring, web and app blocking, and location restrictions.  Prices start at $69.99 for the 1-month plan, $119.99 for the 3-month plan, and $199.99 for the 12-month plan. If you want to use mSpy for non-jailbroken devices, this is also the same price points that will be given to you. The most expensive plan is the Family Kit, but it does let you monitor up to three devices at once. It costs $359.97 for a 6-month plan and $479.97 for a 12-month plan.   Outside of Android and iOS devices, you can also use mSpy to track computers. However, tracking for computers is very limited, which is why there’s only a Basic Plan available for mSpy’s desktop version.  You can use it on both Windows computers and on Macs. The pricing is similar to the Basic Plan for mobile devices, albeit a bit more affordable. Prices start at $26.99 for the 1-month plan, $39.99 for the 3-month plan, and $69.99 for the 12-month plan. There’s also a Family Kit package for the mSpy desktop app, which allows monitoring of up to three computers at the same time. It costs $119.97 for a 6-month plan and $167.97 for a 12-month plan.  As you can see, if you want to save money, it’s always better to buy a long-term plan. In fact, the savings you can accrue when buying 12-month plans are so substantial that it wouldn’t be financially smart at all to buy a short-term plan.  It’s very easy to install mSpy on your target device. Before starting, make sure that you’ve selected and paid for one of the plans listed above.  Once you’ve confirmed your payment, you’ll receive a welcome email that grants you access to your online dashboard – the Control Panel. Follow the link to the mSpy website and you’ll be able to install mSpy on any device you wish. The actual installation process varies depending on the device you’re installing the app on. Here’s a detailed guide on how to install mSpy on Android and iOS devices. In order to install mSpy on a rooted or jailbroken phone, you will need a registration code. To find mSpy’s registration code, you need to go back to the screen that showed up when you were installing mSpy for the first time. As an alternative, you can reach out to mSpy support and ask them to provide you the code. When installing mSpy on Android devices, you need to have physical access to the phone that you want to monitor. Also, make sure that the phone is fully charged and connected to the internet at all times. Again, you need physical access to the phone in order to install the mSpy app.  There’s no need for physical access to the device if you’re installing mSpy on iPhone or other iOS devices since the app can grant you access by simply entering the iCloud credentials of your target device.  This means that you can install mSpy remotely on non-jailbroken iPhones, iPads, and iPods.  If you need to uninstall the app from a phone or detect if a phone has it installed at all, head over to our post where we explain in detail how to remove mSpy from an Android device and iPhone. mSpy is a perfectly legal app. You can use it to track your child’s mobile activity or even to monitor your employees for work purposes, provided that they’re aware of its existence. mSpy is completely safe to use. The information from the target device will only be accessible to the user and will not be stored on mSpy’s servers. It means the data will not be saved there for later use (like if you remove the internet connection from the phone). No, mSpy is virtually undetectable except on the Control Panel of the user. The app is known for being so discreet that even your credit card bill will show your subscription under PayPro or paypro-charge.com. mSpy doesn’t show up at all on the target phone. On non-jailbroken iPhones, the app only accesses iCloud backups, which means there are no dangers of accidentally getting discovered by the owner. On Android phones, the app works quietly in the background, without the owner’s knowledge. Data usage is a little higher with mSpy installed, due to all the constant uploading of data. Depending on how much the target device uses data normally, it could be quite noticeable. The target device has to be connected at all times for the data to be updated on the Control Panel. Without a Wi-Fi or data connection, the mSpy app on the target device won’t be able to transmit data to your online dashboard. mSpy tracks when the location is turned off, and it can still track the target device even without it. The only requirement is that the device remains connected to the internet. Even without root access, mSpy is able to access GPS location, keystrokes, and media, among many others. The app works on all Android devices with an OS of at least Android 4+. Jailbreaking the phone is necessary to access all the features, but you’ll still be able to see a few things like GPS location and call logs even without jailbreak, as long as it’s an iOS device with an OS of at least iOS 7. mSpy is a great parental control app for tracking the mobile activity of your kids or even your employees. You can monitor their app usage, block them from accessing harmful websites, prevent them from using certain apps during school hours or work hours, and track their GPS location, no matter where they are in the world. Installing the app is super easy and you can easily customize it to fit your needs and preferences. As mentioned earlier in this mSpy review, you don’t even need to root or jailbreak your child’s phone or another device first before you can use the app, although there are plenty of benefits to doing so. There are also a variety of plans available for those who may only want to use the mSpy app for a limited time, or who want to use the app on multiple devices at the same time. You can also get the mSpy app for Windows computers or Macs. Aside from that, customer service is top-notch and all support representatives from the company are professional, competent, and very accommodating. If you like keeping a close eye on things and you’re looking for a comprehensive and feature-filled tracking and monitoring parental control app with excellent customer service, mSpy should definitely be on your Top 5 List of cell phone spy apps. It can be a great alternative to other monitoring apps that are no longer accepting new customers and free parental control apps. And there you have it for our comprehensive mSpy review!

Devices open myriad possibilities for us, such as staying connected when we’re separated by huge distances, being aware of the latest news, and diving into details about the lives of people we follow on social media. Although a cell phone is associated with privacy (as you utilize your personal customized device), it can also become a source of trouble. That’s why you can face a situation when you urgently need to know how to track a cell phone number without them knowing.          It’s natural if you sometimes need to make a challenging decision, such as tracking phone number of another person to safeguard them. For instance, if people are bullying or harassing your kids, you might want to make sure they’re staying safe on their way home from school. Or, if your partner is taking a little longer than usual to get home from work, you might want to see their exact location to make sure they’re safe and haven’t gotten into a road accident. All in all, preventing people close to you from getting into trouble is normal. And, of course, it’s a good idea to benefit from using modern technologies, such as remote location tracking. If you want to know how to track a phone number, keep reading this article. We’ll discuss the most reliable ways to find location using cell phone number. If you’re in dire need of locating someone by phone number, there are two awesome solutions to help you out. You can use an online location-identifying service or monitor someone else’s whereabouts with a monitoring app.  Whatever reasons you have to track someone’s location, you might have already searched for a phone tracker by number without them knowing. The good news is that such trackers exist and Localize is one of the best options. Localize is a phone locator that works on all cell phones and allows tracking any mobile phone number (since it’s compatible with all mobile network providers). What’s more, it doesn’t require installation and allows locating as many devices as you want. In a nutshell, you need to visit the Localize.mobi official site, type in phone number and find location. The whole procedure will take you about two minutes. However, before you purchase a subscription, we recommend that you learn more about how it works. Here’s what you need to know:  Localize is perfect when you need to locate someone urgently. However, if you want to gain deeper insight into another person’s smartphone activity, we recommend that you try a monitoring app. If you have ever wondered how to monitor someone else’s online activity, you might have heard about parental control apps. These tools require installation on a target person’s phone. But in exchange, they provide you with detailed information about someone else’s online behavior, including their whereabouts. Most monitoring apps offer a similar set of functions and monitor the target person’s activity in real-time. It means that you can track their exact location anytime without sending requests. What’s more, you can set geofencing and get alerts when a user leaves or enters areas marked as restricted. The only disadvantage is that a parental control app needs to be installed on someone else’s phone, and some apps even require you to root or jailbreak a target device.  If you seek an app that can give you full insight into someone else’s smartphone activity, mSpy is what you need. It’s a feature-packed solution that allows tracking another person’s GPS location in real-time and setting geofences. Since mSpy saves all monitored data to your user dashboard, you can see the route history of a target user anytime. What’s more, mSpy can detect the Wi-Fi networks connected to the target device, which gives you a better idea about their recent whereabouts. Another great solution to find location with phone number is Spyic. It’s a monitoring app that allows locating someone in seconds. The app is popular, as millions of people use it in about 190 countries of the world. The good thing about Spyic is that you don’t need to jailbreak or root the target phone to see its location. You only need to purchase a subscription, install it on another person’s phone, and check their Internet activity. Another parental control app that can come in handy is MMGuardian. Just like other apps, it allows tracking another person’s location in real-time. But unlike some of the competition, MMGuardian makes it possible to see someone’s location as far back as 7 days ago. What’s more, you can see the target person’s physical speed in miles per hour. It means that you can get an idea of their method of transportation. Sometimes tracking another person’s location is the only way to make sure they’re safe and sound. There’s nothing wrong with gaining peace of mind by checking on someone you love and appreciate. There’s nothing to worry about if you decide to use Localize. Since the service requires the target person’s consent for location sharing, you aren’t violating anyone’s privacy or breaking the law. If you give preference to a parental control app, make sure the target person knows about being monitored. Remember, you can secretly track the location of another person only if they’re your underage kids. It’s up to you whether to choose a monitoring app or Localize. Just make sure that the chosen way to track location corresponds to your needs. Your email address will not be published.

Used them in past WO problem, it seems their service has expired beyond just collecting your money. Tip for consumers: Don't! Go AnyWhere Else.. Products used: Purchase mspy for apple iPhone for $119.99 Support for $53.99 Extra Support for $12.99 Dear Customer, Please accept our apologies due to the inconvenience caused by this problem. We would really appreciate if you provide us with your Customer ID or email address. As soon as we locate your account, we will do our best to assist you promptly and solve this issue. Thank you for your understanding and patience! They charged me for a year... Actually they double charged me and it wasn't easy to get a refund for the duplicate charge. The service sucks to begin with then it stopped working completely after a couple of months... Blank white screen. I'm done, don't want the subscription anymore and they say they can't give me a refund. They only email, you can't talk to a person and each email takes 3-4 days. I'd give a negative review if I could. Dear Customer, I’m sorry to hear about your disappointment with us and I would like to personally assist you with making things right. Please provide me with your customer ID so that we can check it further and offer an alternative for you. Thank you for your understanding and patience! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Originally had issues even accessing the site. The was down, requested refund and to close this account as basic functions not working and is unacceptable. Gave me a complete lack of confidence in the product. Sent in request and they refused to refund because they cancelled the account first instead of telling me I need to accept tech help before giving refund. Definitely bad business practice and bad customer service over all. * mSpy attempted to help this customer through the Sitejabber Resolution Center, but the customer did not respond The amount of help from the company coupled with the average response time via email being 9-14 days on average is terrible. The features promised are not available. I paid for 3 months in advance, ask to cancel with a refund within days due to lack of promised features only to be told all they can offer is to chat with me about install. There are no customer service numbers, no guarantees, no help whatsoever. They wouldn't even refund the remaining two months. Stay away, any other service has to be better than this. Tip for consumers: Just don’t, trust me please. Dear Customer, Please accept our apologies due to the inconvenience caused by this problem. We would really appreciate if you provide us with your Customer ID or email address. As soon as we locate your account, we will do our best to assist you promptly and solve this issue. Thank you for your understanding and patience! App never tracks anything. At first they refused to refund me my money and when they finally did, I get didn't get the full amount back. Big scam. Stay away from this app. I got my self an hacker I searched through Google who helped me with what I wanted. I'll recommend him instead Hackrakesh on insta gram. Tip for consumers: Do not use Mspy, all they advertise is a lie. Products used: Hackrakesh on instagram Dear Customer, I’m sorry to hear about your disappointment with us and I would like to personally assist you with making things right. We respect your decision to apply for reimbursement, we cannot proceed with your refund without knowing the exact reason. We would kindly ask you to specify your issue in detail and we would really happy to solve it as soon as possible. Thank you for your understanding and patience! After paying the subscription fee, I realized that this won't work for me. Immediately I sent them a message to ask for a refund and these scams never did. They want 7 days to pass so that they will reply and say 7 days has passed and we cannot refund you. I hate these scams because they too fast when it comes to taking money from our accounts but they will not follow on the emails you sending them after that. I will only remove my review after getting my refund. Tip for consumers: People beware, mspy is too fast when it's comes to taking money from your bank account. They always ready and up for your money but customer service you won't get because they are too busy and they will reply after ... Business days. Which is the blue because they only care about your money and not about you. Subscribe at your own risk, they will show you flames these cruel scams. Products used: I didn't use nothing from these scams Dear Customer, thank you for choosing mSpy! Please accept our sincere apologies for these temporary inconveniences. Please provide me with your customer ID so that i can check it further and offer an alternative for you. Looking forward to hearing from you. DO NOT BUY! Despite chats with their customer service and sending the exact make and model of the phone only after purchase they admitted it could not be rooted although that was my first question! Now I am still being refused a refund despite requesting it 10 days after purchase in February 2020 having never installed the software! DO NOT TRUST THEM! A company that refused to refund such small amount simply CANNOT BE TRUSTED! Happy to send proof of purchase and copies of emails and chats.

Our Customer Care is available 24/7 to assist you with any challenges that you may experience when setting up or using our product. We kindly ask you to reconsider our suggestion from the previous correspondence with our Billing Department. Kind regards, MSpy Team I had to speak with 8 individuals over the course of two months, continually asking since day 2 for a full refund. They gave me a hard time and sent me in circles, & they charge money to speak to someone on the phone. After finally approving my refund, there is a 9% fee for some BS bank processing. They display false advertising saying a non-jail broken iPhone can have SMS text and browser history viewed, calls, etc., but it can't. They literally make money off of their 9% fee after cancelling for getting people to sign up when they can't do what they say they can. It took me pressuring to get my lawyer involved for them to even acknowledge my refund. As someone who has spent decades in sales and customer service, this company is TERRIBLE. Stay away! Tip for consumers: Just don’t. Dear Customer, Thank you for your review, all feedback is important to us and we are sorry to hear that you have had such a frustrating experience. We would like to resolve this issue as quickly as possible and find a solution that works for you. Currently, we have several ways to monitor an iPhone.

Thank you for your understanding and your patience! Thi company charged me 2 times bad experience for me. No telephone number they don't reply to email I'm so pis off. * mSpy attempted to help this customer through the Sitejabber Resolution Center, but the customer did not respond Dear Customer, thank you for choosing mSpy! Please accept our sincere apologies for these temporary inconveniences. Please provide me with your customer ID so that i can check it further and offer an alternative for you. Looking forward to hearing from you. Let me tell you that: this app is fa-bu-lous! My teenage daughter just got her driver's license and of Course she wants to hang out with her friends driving around town. I was scared to death that something could happen and I was not able to help, so I installed mspy on her phone and use it as a GPS tracker. At least now I know where she is every single moment and if I feel much more relaxed. Thanks mspy! I'd give ZERO stars if it were an option. They are terrible. I paid full price to use on my daughter's iPhone and can't use half of the services. On top of that, they've had technical issues with breaking thru on iPhones for the past MONTH and I can't get a refund at all. No one responds quickly enough and they kept trying to extend my 1 year purchase instead of refunding. I do NOT endorse this company. Waste of money and they do NOT advise upfront the lack of service you get on iPhones compared to Android. I am furious and will not stop pestering them until I have my refund. BEWARE! Dear Customer, We regret that the application was beyond your expectations. Our Billing Department did confirm that the full refund has been successfully processed in your favor. In the meantime, the issue with Iphones monitoring has been already fixed by the development team. All refunds are processed by our billing processor and once the refund is issued you will receive a corresponding notification with the necessary details. Kind regards, MSpy Team I did not see the $199 at the bottom until check out very misleading $12.99 month advertisement and they didn't put the $199 below it i asked for a refund never used service same day stated NO BOW THEY SAYING my issue is still be processed they are misleading an taking hard working people money during these hard times it's ridiculous Tip for consumers: Do not purchase Products used: Misleading * mSpy attempted to help this customer through the Sitejabber Resolution Center, but the customer did not respond Dear Customer, We regret to hear about your experience. Please check the latest correspondence with our Billing department to resolve your issue as soonest. If you have any other questions please let us know. Thank you, MSpy Team The billing team contact me to advise they wont refund because the software is working. This software has now failed again saying again data connection lost - for the second time after I have reinstalled. This is unacceptable! Every excuse under the sun not to refund! ------ Finally received a partial refund. Tip for consumers: Do not purchase! Products used: Mspy tracking app Dear Customer, Please accept our apologies due to the inconvenience caused by this problem. With this letter we confirm that the partial refund has been successfully processed in your favor. If you have any questions, please contact us. Kind Regards, I was informed my device should be alright to monitor snapchat otherwise i can request a refund. I purchased the 1 year and tried everything as per requested by mspy team but nothing worked and the answer was that I cant monitor snapchat on iso. I requested a refund so many times but they wont refund me and ask me to read their policy. I was traped from them. They are hopeless! Do Not Buy mspy! Products used: Mspy Dear Customer, We’re sorry your experience didn’t match your expectations Please note that your case is non-refundable according to the mSpy policy, we suggest a partial refund — 30% of the amount paid. At the same time, you will have an opportunity to continue using the software within your subscription plan for monitoring another target device during the billing period. Please let us know if this offer is suitable, and we will proceed with a partial refund. Looking forward to hearing from you. This company doesn't deserve one star they are that horrible. You have to pay before they even give you instructions on how to operate the app. When you try to chat with customer service they don't help you except direct you to some bogus site. I bought it tried to figure how to set it up and 2 hours later cancelled just to find out 11 days later they won't refund me. DON'T BUY INTO THESE CROOKS! * mSpy attempted to help this customer through the Sitejabber Resolution Center, but the customer did not respond Dear Customer, We regret to hear about your experience. Please check the latest correspondence with our Billing department to resolve your issue as soonest. If you have any other questions please let us know. Thank you, MSpy Team Dan Armstrong was very helpful each time I needed technical support. The app has a few quirks but overall very good. Software is a total rip-off. I was worried that it would not work on the target device, so I asked the support agent on their page if it would. He promised me it would work fine so I bought the premium service. Turns out it doesn't work on the device at all. And still, after blatantly lying to me and even admitting in a support ticket that it doesn't work as advertised they won't refund me! Don't buy this piece of crap! Tip for consumers: Don't buy this! Dear Customer, We regret to hear about your experience. Please provide your customer information so we can identify your account and provide an efficient solution as soon as possible. Thank you, MSpy Team I am very happy with mspy software srvices, and this is the reason. I have to start off by saying that this app is awesome. I didn't know products like this existed until a friend told me about it and I am very thankful they did. It allows me to track my employee's phones to make sure they are using our company phones for business purposes only. It grants me access to emails, text messages and calls, among many other things. This product is definitely a life and money saver! The service does not work at all on iOS. They will only take your money and make you wait on a fix while suspending service. They will make you wait several days to hear from the sales department about a possible refund. I wish I would have read reviews about the service before I purchased. They say it's compatible with iOS and no jailbreak but this is not true at all. BUYER Beware! Tip for consumers: Zero Stars until I receive a full refund for false claims of services they can provide. This is basically a SCAM having to wait several business days on a possible refund! Do not purchase MSpy! Products used: Mspy Premium Dear Customer, We are sorry to hear that at the moment you cannot use the product the way you want it to be used. Currently, we have several ways to monitor an iPhone.We recommend you to visit our live chat and our technical support representative will walk you through the process, which will take only 10-15 minutes of your time. In a live chat simply ask to try out the new solution for iPhones and you will be guided further. Thank you for your understanding and patience! I'm not sure where the positive reviews are coming from but I would not trust this company. I have been trying to ascertain a refund for the best part of 3 weeks and I started well within their 14 day refund policy. The company has stayed quiet, not really responding to any of my emails. Don't by into the idea that the pandemic is whats causing delays, as they were VERY RESPONSIVE when trying to secure payment Not Recommended! Tip for consumers: don't buy the product Products used: none Dear Customer, We are sorry for the inconveniences that you might have faced and we would like to offer you several solutions.

It is very frustrating because they have announced a services 24/7 that it is false * mSpy attempted to help this customer through the Sitejabber Resolution Center, but the customer did not respond Dear Customer, I’m sorry to hear about your disappointment with us and I would like to personally assist you with making things right. Please provide me with your customer ID so that we can check it further and offer an alternative for you. Thank you for your understanding and patience! If I could leave minus stars I would. I spoke to the team online before purchasing this to protect my daughter and was promised I could see who she was messaging with her iCloud details and needing the phone for 5 minutes. However I followed the instructions and it doesn't show anything. I paid £74.99 for a year but was told I could request a refund if it didn't work. I have emailed them and so far been ignored. I really feel they have taken advantage of me and I can't afford to pay this kind of money for no service. - I will take this to trading standards Dear Customer, I understand your frustration and I am sorry that you feel this way. We would really appreciate if you provide us with your Customer ID or email address. As soon as we locate your account, we will do our best to assist you promptly and solve this issue.

        "body": "Internet Security Reviews The popularity of social media has enabled people from all around the world to connect. But for all the good it does, social media is full of potential dangers to children. This presents a unique problem for many parents. One way to solve this issue is by using parental control software that concerned parents can employ to regulate and monitor social media use. Two great examples of that are Bark and mSpy. Both monitor activity and notify parents of anything alarming. But while their monitoring capabilities are unmatched, they’re not the cheapest solutions. To help you make sure you choose the right one, we took a closer look at some of the key differences between them. One of the most popular choices for parents since 2015, Georgia-based Bark already protects millions of American children. What makes Bark stand out is that it employs artificial intelligence to monitor and analyze social media activity and alerts parents to signs of cyberbullying, violence, and other serious issues. This is possible because Bark covers an impressive number of social media networks, including Facebook, Snapchat, and TikTok. Whether it’s text, audio, images, or even text taken from images, Bark will be able to pick up on the most subtle clues. You can also change how strict your notifications are, so you don’t get a message every time your kids talk about a fight at school, but you will receive alerts about direct threats of violence.       The best part is that through all of this, Bark is constantly giving you advice on how to use each feature, react to results, and talk with your child – making the app much more than just an extra pair of eyes. Bark is available on a range of devices, including iOS, Android, Chromebook, and Amazon Fire tablets. However, there is no solution for desktop users besides a Google Chrome extension. The price depends on whether you pay monthly or annually, with discounts for the latter. And while it isn’t the cheapest solution on the market, users can test out the service first through the 7-day free trial. If Bark’s extensive monitoring options don’t go far enough, then mSpy surely has you covered. Created in the UK back in 2010, mSpy has different capabilities depending on how far you want to go. To unlock all the monitoring options, iOS users will need to jailbreak the device first, although Android users experience far fewer issues. And while mSpy’s customer support will help you through the process via the website’s live chat, it still isn’t the easiest parental control software to install. Once installed, mSpy lets you see just about everything on your child’s device like SMS messages, social media posts, and installed apps. You’re even able to view photos and videos saved on the device. Both Bark and mSpy show parents their child’s location, but only mSpy offers geofencing that gives you notifications if a child goes out of bounds.       mSpy works on Android and iOS, but it isn’t available on any other device, so you won’t be able to monitor tablets or desktops. Prices depend on how much monitoring you’ll be doing but for the basic service the cost is exactly the same as Bark. If you want the full range of capabilities, then you can expect to pay double the price. Fortunately, there’s a 7-day free trial to try out the software first to see if it’s worth the extra investment. If you took just a brief glance at Bark and mSpy you would be forgiven for thinking that they’re very similar parental control tools. However, the more you delve into them, the more obvious it is that they are two very different beasts. Bark is much more conventional parental control software with great social media coverage. Meanwhile, mSpy is a monitoring software first, that just happens to be beneficial to parents. So, while Bark gives you advice on how best to help you and your child deal with social media threats, mSpy encourages you to jailbreak your phone to unlock extra monitoring options. Both come with free trials, allowing you to thoroughly test them out and see which one suits your family the most.

Unfortunately, that’s still the harsh reality in 2021. With mSpy becoming an effective monitoring tool, many people use it to spy on someone’s smartphone and keep track of their online activities. If you’re also worried that someone is spying on you using mSpy, it is important to take effective measures to keep your privacy intact. To help you along the way, we’ve compiled a comprehensive guide on how to stop mSpy from spying on your smartphone. So, without any further ado, let’s quickly dive into the guide. For users who don’t know, mSpy is a dedicated spying tool that’s primarily marketed to parents and employers to keep a check on their children and employees respectively. However, it’s safe to say that the app is being used by many third-parties to collect user’s personal information and utilize it for marketing purposes. What makes mSpy the go-to tool for device monitoring is the fact that the company advertises it as an invisible spying tool. It means that one can install it on your smartphone without you noticing it at all. Fortunately, this statement is partially true.     During our research, we found that it is quite possible to detect the presence of mSpy on your smartphone using different methods. These methods include: 1 Antivirus Programs Flag mSpy as a Virus If you want to know if mSpy is installed on your smartphone or not, simply install an Antivirus program and perform a deep device scan. The majority of Antivirus tools in the market are capable of detecting spyware apps like mSpy and list them as a potential Virus threat. 2 mSpy Can Be Found in Application Manager As surprising as it may sound, you can find mSpy on your smartphone’s application manager. However, this method works only half the time as such spyware apps are usually listed under a different name. So, if you find any unusual app in the application manager, there’s a high probability that it might be mSpy. 3 mSpy Is Listed in the Download List If someone has downloaded mSpy on your smartphone, it will be listed in the “Downloads” directory unless the person has manually deleted it. So, make sure to check the “Downloads” folder and see if you can find mSpy or not. While the above method can indicate the presence of mSpy on a smartphone, it’s still important to take the required measures to stop it from spying on your device. So, let’s quickly take a look at the best tips on how to stop someone spying using mSpy on iPhone and Android. Among all the possible reasons, location tracking is the primary goal for people to use a monitoring tool like mSpy. When someone wants to track your GPS movement, all they have to do is install mSpy on your device and use it to track your real-time location on the map. One of the most effective ways to restrict mSpy location tracking is to use a location spoofing tool. Location spoofing tools are designed to alter your real GPS location and set it to anywhere in the world. As a result, mSpy will only track a fake location and be unable to know your whereabouts.     Using a location spoofing app becomes more useful when you cannot uninstall mSpy but don’t want to disclose your location either. For instance, if your parents have the app on your device, you might not be able to delete it, but sometimes you wanna keep a secret of where have you been. So, here are the two best and most convenient location spoofing apps for iOS and Android users you can see which fits you best. Since iDevices are extremely secure, it is imperative to find the right spoofing app that can help you set a fake location on the device. Fortunately, iMyFone AnyTo fits the description just right. The tool boasts a multitude of features and a user-friendly interface that’ll make it extremely easier for people to fake their GPS location. In addition to this, you can also use iMyFone AnyTo to create fake GPS movements and trick mSpy. 1,000,000+ Downloads What make iMyFone AnyTo the most reliable GPS spoofing app: Try It FreeTry It Free Here’s the step-by-step process on how to stop someone spying using mSpy on an iPhone using iMyFone AnyTo.

Step 1: Install and launch the app on your desktop/laptop and click “Get Started”.   Step 2: Connect your phone to the computer via USB.

Try It FreeTry It Free Normally, if you’re an Android user, you’ll be able to directly install the location spoofing app on your phone. However, in this case the process will be slightly different. Let’s walk you through the step-by-step procedure of setting a fake GPS location on an Android device. Step 1: Go to Google Play Store and download GPS Emulator on your device.   Step 2: Once the app is successfully downloaded, you’ll have to set it as the default Mock Location app. To do so, go to \"Settings > Developer Options > Set Mock Location app\" and select \"GPS Emulator\".

While some people still think mSpy a threat to their privacy and feel like mSpy tracking their other activities like calls and messages, browsing history, Whatsapp conversations, etc. So, if you want no further worries, we recommend using a dedicated anti-spyware app to find and remove mSpy from your device.     When there’s a spyware app on your device, these apps will create alerts and even automatically uninstall the application. Whether you use an Android device or an iPhone, there are several anti-spyware tools you can use to remove spyware tools and keep your personal information protected.

        "body": "School's back, and for many students it's an in-person experience. While that's amazing for kids' social-emotional development and learning, it also means that parents have less visibility into their digital lives. But don't worry -- child safety website mSpy lets you view your child’s social media activity (including Snapchat and Instagram), browser history, call logs, contact lists and much more. And the big news? You can even read text messages that have been DELETED on both Android and iPhone without a jailbreak. Text message monitoring has been of huge interest in recent years. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, kids 8-10 spend an average of six hours per day in front of a screen, kids 11-14 spend nine hours, and youth 15-18 spend nearly eight hours per day – and that increased during the pandemic. Getting kids back to normal screentime levels is going to be tough, parents don’t often know what their child is doing on their phone, and their kids aren’t always forthcoming with what’s going on in their lives. From sending seemingly innocent (but potentially provocative) photos, to online solicitations, sexting, or befriending some less-than-desirable characters, kids can make mistakes caused by youthful inexperience. Those actions can end up haunting a child and parent forever, but mSpy gives parents access and visibility into their child’s world. mSpy works on both Android AND iPhone, and you can monitor everything without needing to jailbreak it, which can invalidate the iPhone warranty. Once you register with mSpy and connect it to your child’s phone, the data gets downloaded to your private website login page where you can read all the text messages your child has sent and received. You can also view their photos and videos, emails, phone call logs, phone contacts and web browsing history, and monitor their social media messages on Tinder, Kik, Snapchat, Instagram, Skype, Facebook, WhatsApp and many more. Wondering where your child is? GPS tracking shows where they are in real time, and mSpy’s Geofencing feature lets you set safe boundaries for where you child can travel – like from school to grandma’s house to your home. If they travel outside these virtual barriers, you’re alerted. Parents can also view their child’s phone apps, block apps from working, and record their screen. There really is no other phone monitoring tool as comprehensive as mSpy. Check out all their features. Yes! As long as you are the parent or guardian of the child, it’s legal. What’s more, mSpy is invisible – the app does not appear on your child’s phone so they won’t know it’s there unless you tell them. Should you tell them? That decision is up to you. Every family is different, and when it comes to protecting your children it’s sometimes good to open a dialogue. Other times, it’s better to be discreet, such as when your child has already run into trouble and you’re trying to prevent him or her from encountering bigger problems. Right now, with summer here and more free time on kids’ hands, mSpy is offering great discounted rates. You can get 30% off a one-month trial, 60% off three months, and a whopping 83% off the monthly rate if you subscribe for a year. So, whether you’re giving your child a phone for the first time and just want to keep an eye on them, or you have a teen exposed to more than they’re ready to handle, mSpy could be your way to safely and anonymously observe them without being a helicopter parent.

        "body": "Home > Spy > How Can I Spy on a Cell Phone Without Installing Software on the Target Phone Updated: October 13, 2021 Cell phone monitoring is one of the best ways to catch a cheating spouse. However, spying on a person’s cell phone can be very difficult, especially when you need to do it on a cell phone without installing any software. The big question is, is it really possible to spy on a target’s cell phone with the best cell phone spy apps on it? While some providers say it is practically impossible, some say it is easy to do. In this article, you are going to learn how to track a cell phone location without installing software on target phone. We’ll mention spy apps, but also some other methods. This article is divided into three main parts: SPY ON ANY CELL PHONE NOW Yes, you can spy on a cell phone without physical access to it by using phone tracker apps. These spy apps were designed specifically to spy on a cell phone remotely and monitor their phone without their knowledge. Here’s how to use these apps to spy on a cell phone remotely: A phone spy app can give you access to more than the target phone GPS location. One of these cell phone spy apps with extensive features is mSpy. mSpy mobile spy app has a simple interface alongside a user-friendly dashboard which you can use to spy on a cell phone that’s Android and iPhones. The applications are endless – you can use them to spy on your boyfriend or even check up on your employees. With mSpy spy app, you can: To use the mSpy mobile spy app, you’ll need to: Step 1: Subscribe to the mSpy “No jailbreak” spying app package. Step 2: Select the target device to be monitored and input their credentials with these spyware apps. Step 3: Monitor their cell phone remotely from your mSpy spy app dashboard. To spy on someone’s cell phone without installing cell phone spy software or jailbreaking the iPhone, both iCloud credentials (Apple ID and password) and backup are required for monitoring and tracking an iOS cell phone without jailbreaking. But, you can use spyware apps with a dedicated no-jailbreak package. There are three significant steps to know how to put cell phone spy apps on a cell phone for monitoring purposes. Below we present the best cell phone spy app, mSpy as an example. iOS devices synchronize immediately with Apple cloud storage and downloads all cell phone activity. Therefore, if you know your target phone Apple credentials, you can easily spy on them. You can know your target’s exact location, read their text messages, and monitor their phone activities without installing any software program or phone spy apps. Basically, there are 3 ways you can spy on an iPhone without physically accessing your target’s phone. They are: Find My iPhone is inbuilt spy software for iPhone users. The spy app allows iPhone users to spy on cell phone activity and locate their phone when it’s misplaced or stolen. While they don’t have any advanced features like seeing incognito history, for example, they’re still a decent replacement, as long as the location services are enabled on their phone.  However, you can also use Find My iPhone to spy on your target device. This approach will grant you access to your target’s location only.  Step 1: Launch the Find My iPhone app on your Apple device or visit iCloud.com/find on your web browser. Step 2: Enter your target’s Apple ID and password and select All Devices. Step 3: Click on “Find iPhone.” Wait for your target’s location to pop up. Like “Find My iPhone,” cell phone spy app, this program is also preinstalled on every Apple device. You can use it to track your target’s location and also to monitor their movements. This is a great free couple tracker if your spouse uses iPhone and you don’t want to break a bank trying to catch them cheating. One major downside of using this approach is that you will need your target’s consent. Here are the procedures to follow: Step 1: Launch the Find My Friends app on your Apple device. Step 2: Tap the “Add” button, select their name or email address. Send your request. Step 3: Wait for the target to accept the request. It is a bit harder to spy on Android cell phones. They have nothing to do with Cloud data storage, which complicates the situation. Nonetheless, there is a way around it. A good spy option can be hidden installation of spyware on the target cell phones. To do this, you do not have to touch the device. Simply send a link for undetected file installation, and the user will do everything themselves without understanding what happened There are three primary ways you can spy on a target that’s using an Android phone. They include: Android Device Manager is an in-built spy app for Android that allows Android phone users to track their phone when the phone is stolen or misplaced. This spy app for Android can be used to track your target’s location as long as they are connected to the Internet. Here’s is how you can track your target using the Android phone manager: Step 1: Log in to google.com/android/devicemanger on your browser. Step 2: Enter your target’s Google Account credentials. Step 3: You’ll be shown your target’s location. Like the app we mentioned above, Google Timeline helps you to track the target’s location as long as it is connected to the Internet. To track your target phone using the Google Timeline spy app for Android, you’ll need: Step 1: Open Google Map on your browser. Step 2: Sign in with your target’s Google Account.    Step 3: Click on “Menu” from the top side of your screen. After then, click on “Your Timeline” to spy on an Android cell phone without physical access.  Thanks to so many software and tool options on the market, spying on a cell phone without having it has never been easier. You can use other less expensive, but more difficult methods to crack a target phone. To spy on a cell phone using these methods, you need to have advanced programming knowledge and some additional cell phone spy tools. Here are some more advanced methods you can use to spy on a cell phone without having it for free. If you are trying to bust a cheater and learn how to spy on a cell phone without having it, you can easily use phishing or couple tracker applications. While mobile trackers are much easier to use, phishing is free. Phishing is a practice of sending emails that induce people into clicking on malicious or dangerous attachments or links. They usually imitate legitimate organizations or people so they would entice you into opening the said link. Upon clicking these malicious links, they will be caused to provide personal and sensitive information like passwords, bank account numbers, and credit cards. The one major downside to phishing is that it is very technical and may not be suitable if you do not have advanced computer skills.    This type of method involves sneaking to access your target’s phone whenever it’s left unlocked. After you’ve gained access to the target phone, go to the security setting and add your fingerprint to their Touch ID. This cell phone monitoring method involves making wild guesses of your target’s password combination, judging from their personal information. Not only is this approach not efficient, but it also consumes a lot of time. It likely won’t let you achieve the goal to spy on someone’s Android phone or iPhone.    Tons of websites will promise you to get your target’s information without target phone for a small fee. These websites are mostly fraudulent and only want to trick you by offering spying on a cell phone for free, when instead, you’ll get infected with malware. So, don’t even think about using any of these mobile spy websites.  Cell phone spy apps play a role in spying on mobile devices without having to install other cell phone spy software. While there are different types of phone spy apps to track phone activity, mSpy is flexible and very easy to use. mSpy is a cell phone monitoring software that allows parents to monitor the mobile activities of their wards. Using a cell phone spy app on an Android phone requires that you install the app on your target phone. However, using mSpy makes it very possible to spy on your target without accessing their phone. With mSpy spy phone app, you can send a download link via email or text to your target. And with just a click, you’ll install software on the target phone without them being notified. Step 1: Select the mSpy cell phone monitoring app subscription plan based on your preference and make the required payment. Step 2: Download the mSpy phone tracking software and install the software on the target mobile – you’ll need one-time physical access. Step 3: Log on to the control panel to monitor the phone’s incoming and outgoing calls, activities, operations performed on the target phone. Looking closely at the different types of ways of tapping someone’s device without touching it, the perfect option is using mobile spy apps like mSpy, which offers the best flexibility both on Android or iOS. With these spying apps, there’s no need to learn how to track a cell phone location without installing any software on target phone because it does all the heavy lifting for you, Other alternative methods of tracking someone such as phishing, snooping and social engineering are unreliable, ineffective, and can come with a lot of risks.

Thank you My boyfriend changed his number on me Again. So I don’t have his number. But I bought him the phone (android) so I have the IMEI#. is there anyway I can see his location? He has cheated and if he is where I think he is really need to know. I’ve explained all about IMEI tracking before, but the short answer is that you’ll need physical access to his phone at least once to track him. You can’t do it remotely, I’m afraid. Good articles, apps and service deserves all the accolades, that’s why I’ll forever applaud the efforts of the most reliable tech gal who helped me spy through my husband’s cellphone within the shortest possible time. Sometimes hiring a professional to take care of things like snooping into tech devices, might be frustrating, but believe me the frustration is not as much as finding out the truth that your loved one has been a cheat behind you, so I’d rather say it’s a relief finding a portal of tech savvy people like you guys. i want to hack my husband WhatsApp i don’t have access to the phone i know the email and the password does it help to install?

        "body": "JUST IN: The all-new Screen Recorder for Android. Learn more.  Introducing all new Android Screen Recorder  It can be pretty daunting to pick the best cell phone monitoring app when you have lots of options. Plus, who has got the time to review all the options and then pick only one. The trouble is that if you subscribe to a bad one, you won’t get a refund. Yep, you will be pretty much stuck with it. That’s why it’s really crucial to evaluate your options pretty closely and then pay for one. But don’t worry, we have made the job easier for you. We bring you the 12 best rated phone spy apps for 2021 that are available out there. With this guide, you will be able to compare the options you have and choose the app that best suits your needs. Let’s begin, shall we? Before you decide which mobile spying app is worth your money, here are some essential or in other words basic features that must be available in your app: Is it compatible with the OS of your phone? It can be either Android or iPhone. You also have to see if the app supports your phone. GPS tracking system lets you track the location of the target phone. A mobile spying app should have this as a crucial feature since you will be interested to know the whereabouts of your children or even employees. These are the most basic features to look for in cell phone spying apps as it is these conversations that can let you get to the bottom of some issue. Plus, some advance apps let you intercept calls and surroundings of the phones too. If you can get these features at a good price, then it is totally worth it. Since it is a spying software, it must be capable of working in discrete mode. You must be able to install it on the target device and be sure it will monitor things for you without being visible on the phone. A cheap app will give you cheap features and a pricey app will give you quality features. But that does not mean you should buy a spying app that is costly. If the app is actually offering great features and it is justifying the price, you can readily go for it. Since there is a huge variety of mobile spy apps these days, you will, of course, have a lot of companies to choose from. Before you purchase any of the best hidden spy apps, it is recommended to do your homework to be sure you have made the right choice. Here are some tips that will help you pick the right company: The product itself may be good but if the customer support is not good, then you may never be able to make the most of the product itself. If the website offers live chat support, test it. Ask a few questions related to the phone spy app and see if they are handled efficiently. Similarly, if a phone number is provided at the website, make sure it’s functional. The website doesn’t just give you a bigger picture of the product but the company itself. A decent company will always have a comprehensive website. Along with having details about the product, its features, tutorials, FAQs, guides, etc. also have information about the company, its location, and availability of support. Make sure the website has Terms and Condition, Privacy Policy and Disclaimer sections. Reading these pages will clear your head and help you decide whether to make a purchase or not. If a digital product bought online doesn’t come with a sound refund policy, then the risk of you losing your money gets pretty high. Because you never really know how the product would turn out to be unless you have already used it. The challenge with the online cell phone spying apps is that not many companies offer a free trial. Why? Because that free trial is most of the times enough for many people. Keeping that contingency into consideration, many top spy apps rather offer a fully-functional online demo in place for the free trial. Xnspy also has an impressive live demo which you could give a try before making a final purchase decision. A lot of people don’t take this into account but you should always consider the location of the company you are buying the mobile spy app from. Choose the company that’s located in your own country so that you don’t have to face time zone constraints. The location of the company also tells about its reliability and quality of services. We hope that this guide came as an answer to most of your questions related to the 12 best mobile spy apps. The purpose of creating this review was to make your decision easier and choose the right mobile spy app. Xnspy is the industry’s leading mobile spyware. It’s the app’s combination of advanced spying features, affordable pricing, and a 24/7 customer support, that all serves up to make Xnspy the best phone monitoring software. Xnspy is not just your surveillance app for the children but for your employees, too. It has everything to keep you updated about their activities in real time. Some of its incredible features include monitoring phone calls and messages, access to instant messenger chats and multimedia sent via these chats, GPS location tracking (this includes monitoring of specific locations, current location, location history and geofencing), email and browser monitoring, recording of phone calls and surroundings, remotely controlling the target phone, and lot more. Xnspy has introduced some few advanced spying features, too, that include Keylogger, Wi-Fi logs and WhatsApp monitoring without rooting. The app keeps on getting better and better. But that’s not all! If your fixation for spying needs a frenzy, keep on reading, because there’s still a lot to be discovered about the best hidden spy apps. It is not just the features of Xnspy that makes it an incredible choice, but also its compatibility. The developers of the app are very good at keeping up with the changes in technology. It is compatible with both Android and iOS devices. For iOS, Jailbreak and no-Jailbreak versions are offered too so that every device owner can use this app without any limitations. Xnspy is an attractive option because of its price, too. It comes in two packages: Xnspy Basic and Xnspy Premium. The Basic Edition costs $4.99 a month and the Premium Edition costs $7.49 a month. These prices, compared to other similar options, are shockingly low. Plus, most of the other phone spy apps that you would read about here don’t have enough to match Xnspy on their features either. Rating: 9.8/10 Flexispy is, without a doubt, one of the top spy apps that works with both iOS and Android. We love Flexispy for its expansive, and some exclusive features, including the ability to access the camera on a phone, keylogging, and so on. And while Flexispy may have a bigger list of features, we weren’t convinced to put this app on the number 1 spot. For instance, some of the Flexispy features are deemed unethical, like its ability to access a phone's camera, or with the keylogger, their passwords can be stolen. And not to forget, Flexispy comes at an eye-watering price of $349. Rating: 9/10 When we talk about parental controls, Qustudio is the name that resonates with us. If you are looking to monitor your children, this might just be the perfect solution. You can set limitations on your children’s screen time, or block apps or websites that they browse. However, an app as good as Qustodio still has a few caveats of its own. For one, you can’t use this app secretively. But why would you? There are many instances where you have to hide from your child that you are overseeing their activity. When kids are susceptible and engaging in dangerous activities online, and know that they are being watched, they might temporarily act normal. If your child is experiencing bullying, depression, or getting exposed to porn, overtly monitoring their activity might not provide you with unbiased results since many children are good at hiding things. Qustodio is very price-friendly. It comes at USD 55 yearly and you can monitor up to 5 devices under a single subscription. Rating: 8.5/10 Here comes another popular mobile spy app of 2021 that helps you record the messages of the victim, their call log, monitor IM chats, web browsing history, keylogger, GPS tracking, geo-fencing, and a lot more. It is capable of running in complete stealth mode so don’t worry, if you want to secretly snoop on someone, this best cell phone monitoring software won’t let you down. The best part is you don’t need to root the device or jailbreak to make it work. It offers some nice and intricate features like video preview and capturing screenshots. Some of these advanced features are not being offered by other spying app vendors. It’s a great app when it comes to features but there are some complaints about its functionality. Android version of Spyzie has two editions. The Ultimate Edition version costs $49.99 a month and it comes with fully functional features. The Premium Version costs $39.99 version but it has restricted functionality. The iOS version’s license costs $49.99 a month. Spyzie appears to be an attractive mobile spying app with tons of features because it is quite pricey. Only the Ultimate Edition offers all functional features. All functions are not operational on the iOS version. Rating: 8/10 MobiStealth is also one of the top 12 mobile spy apps of 2021 that come with a broad range of spying features. It is available in three different packages starting from basic to advanced monitoring features. So the features it is offering include viewing text messages, application list, monitor chat messengers web browsing, track location, emails, pictures, keylogging, surround recording, call recording, and Gmail logging. It offers mobile and computer monitoring, making it a perfect choice for business owners. MobiStealth’s PC monitoring software can help you protect your interests by providing continuously monitoring all online activities. You will be paying around $0.50 a day for these features. No wonder it’s among the best cell phone spy software. MobiStealth supports Android, iPhone and iPad, PC and Mac tracking. For Android Pro: 16.66/ month Pro X: $26.66/month For iOS Premium: $26.66/month Premium Plus: $40/month For Windows: LITE: $13.33/month PRO: $20.00/month For MAC: LITE: $13.33/month MobiStealth’s basic Versions for each of the devices mentioned above offer only basic spying features. You will have to go for the Premium Versions to avail all features. In that case, the app will become really expensive for anyone, whether it is parents or employers and in the long-run, it can break the bank of an average person. Rating: 7.8/10 If you are looking for an office phone monitoring solution or parental control, Clevguard has all the right tools for you. It works with both Android and iOS with extensive social media monitoring on the former. Clevguard also comes with remote controls as that of Xnspy, like the ability to take screenshots or record calls, remotely. Additionally, Clevfguard can take secret photos too, just like Flexispy. All in all, Kidsguard Pro is a great app for your daily monitoring needs. There are no device compatibility-related details on the website but what we do is that Clevguard is compatible with Android, iOS, and PC. Similarly. there’s no definite information on how much it costs to use Clevguard, but on the website, they have mentioned that it will cost you USD 0.27/day. We are assuming this is based on their yearly subscription plan. Rating: 7.6/10 iSpyoo is the mobile spy app meant to check on your employees and protect your children from the hazards of the online world. Since it is a spying app, it becomes completely invisible. The distinguished feature of this top rated cell phone tracking app is that it lets you monitor video calls on Viber and Skype too. Other features it supports include location tracking, read text messages, SMS, view call logs, record calls, view contacts, photos, videos, IM chats, emails, and internet browsing history. There is a free trial version of iSpyoo too. With one account, you can monitor 3 different devices. Cool, right? The only problem is you have to root or jailbreak your device for using most of the features offered by iSpyoo. iSpyoo is compatible with most Android or iOS devices. It does not support Windows or Blackberry phones. In short, it is compatible with any carrier is offering open GPRS internet access. iSpyoo is available in 3 different packages. The higher the package you choose, the better features you will get. Instead of paying a monthly subscription, you can also buy for 3-months, 6 and 1-year subscription according to your budget. Rating: 7.5/10 Here is another mobile spying app for 2021 that lets you monitor all activities on smartphones running iOS, Android and Blackberry. With StealthGenie, you can read incoming and outgoing text messages, emails, call logs, track GPS location, instant messenger chats, remotely monitor the phone and intercept the calls. StealthGenie supports Android, iOS and Blackberry devices. If you want to use StealthGenie on iPhone, you have to jailbreak the device. So, iPhone users aren’t really able to use this app. StealthGenie comes in 3 different packages. Its price is quite competitive. You just have to pay between $8 and $16 per month, depending on the package you purchase. Rating: 7.3/10 NOTE: StealthGenie was a great app but unfortunately, it is no longer available. mSpy is another spy app that is used as a cell phone monitoring app. The app is primarily used as a parental monitoring app. Compared with other apps, mSpy offers a limited number of features. It offers all the basic features that other apps offer, such as monitoring of emails, text messages, browser history, call logs, contact list, multimedia files, location tracking, etc. In addition to this, you can remotely control apps and programs. However, it does not offer advanced features such as call or surroundings recorders. Because of the limited number of features that the app offers, it ranks at number 7 in our list of 12 best mobile spy apps. Users of the app can install mSpy on Android cell phone and tablets. The app is compatible with Android as well as iOS devices. The app is compatible with Android OS 4 and above. To avail the advanced features offered by the app, you need to root your Android device. The app is compatible with all iOS devices from iOS 7 and up. The subscription plans offered by mSpy are expensive. For the number of features that the app offers, the pricing for mSpy does not seem justified. For the Basic subscription plan, you only have the option for a monthly subscription. However, for Premium packages, you can purchase it on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis. The pricings of the subscription plans are mentioned as follows: Rating: 7/10 It is a simple and reliable mobile spy app which common tracking features. If you are looking for a budget option and you don’t need a complicated tool, this one is for you. It lets you access text messages, view call history, photo, videos, track Location, get device information like memory usage, IMEI, browser history, see installed apps, notes, calendars and more. It is compatible with Android and iOS. It only works on jailbroken iPhones. MobileSpyAgent is available in 3 plans; Basic, Pro and Business. The business plan is meant for the users who need multiple licenses and its price is provided as per your spying needs and license requests. Rating: 6.9/10 Appmia is another worthy addition to the 12 best spy apps for phones with its one-time license, ability to monitor two devices at a time, and free upgrades. If you have basic monitoring needs such as call and text message monitoring, location tracking, and access to calendar and address book, Appmia is a good choice. You can monitor a variety of devices with Appmia. Appmia lets you monitor Android devices, iPads, iPhones along with some versions of Nokia Symbian devices and Blackberry phones. Note: The features and functionality varies for each device so, it is better to consult the official website to check the compatibility and access of features. Appmia is an expensive app. Rating: 6.7 /10 Highster Mobile is a popular cell phone tracking application famous for its steal camera, call recording and eavesdropping features. It supports all basic spying features like monitoring call logs, text messages, iMessages, IMs, media files, emails and address book and GPS tracking. It works in absolute covert mode. Its stealth camera feature allows you to take pictures and make videos of the surrounding and view them online. If you want to block an app, a website or uninstall an app, Highster Mobile does not support that. Highster Mobile is compatible with both Android and iOS. Highster Mobile is available for a one-time fee of $69.99. There are no monthly or annual billings. It may not have all advanced spying features but given the features that are being offered, it is a great bargain. Rating: 6/10 The mobile spy app that we would recommend to anyone who is looking for best features, affordability, and reliability is ‘XNSPY’! We have made our recommendation by analyzing and comparing the features of Xnspy with other best spy apps for phones. So, here is what makes Xnspy the right choice: Xnspy works on all latest operating systems for both Android, iPad and iPhones. If you want to monitor an Android Oreo 8.0 device, all features of Xnspy will readily work on it. Similar is the case with Xnspy for iPhone. You will see lots of contenders on the list of top spy apps that either only support Jailbroken iPhones or their advanced monitoring features don’t work on iPhone to begin with. That’s not a problem with Xnspy. It also offers a separate version for devices that are already jailbroken. The developers continue to update the app to keep up with the updates in the operating systems. Xnspy is the best value for money. You might find apps like MobiStealth and Spyzie attractive but after a month or so, these apps become hard to afford for an average person. On the other hand, even the premium edition of Xnspy is the most affordable among all cell phone spying apps if we compare it with the features being offered. Advance monitoring in the form of alerts, geofencing, surround recording and ambient recording come at the price of $14 a month. Similarly, some apps are offering unique features like video call monitoring, keylogger, remote picture and video capturing but to use them, you have to root or jailbreak your device or pay a lot of money. But Xnspy is a package of all essential monitoring features that come at a really affordable price. Customer support provided by Xnspy is quite reliable. They are offering 24/7 live chat support. The website offers tutorials, live demo versions, and comprehensive how-to guides on all features which makes it easier for any user to understand the app. The FAQ section contains answers to most of the questions customers would want to know. However, if you can’t find answers to your queries or you are facing technical difficulties, you will always find support agents to assist you. Xnspy is always on top of the game to hear and address the concerns of its valued customers. Take a look at these features and then see if any app is offering all these at a price that actually is affordable. Xnspy is compatible with most phones and tablets. Android devices with OS 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x. are compatible. iOS devices with iOS versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x up to 15.1 are compatible with the app. Before installing the app on the phone, make sure that it is compatible with the phone. Xnspy is the best hidden spy app when it comes to stealth mode. The app works in hidden mode and is 100% undetectable. The user of the device cannot view the app in the App Listing on the device. Hence, you can monitor the activity on the device discreetly. Xnspy monitors the live location of the device on Android. If the phone is connected to the internet, you will receive regular updates on your account. Xnspy provides details on previous as well as the current location. It includes the address, longitudinal, and latitudinal coordinates. Users can also mark locations as safe or unsafe. Yes, Xnspy is 100% legal. However, the app’s user is responsible for how they intend to use the app. Moreover, if you wish to use the app for monitoring children or employees, the device must belong to you or the company, respectively. For children below the age of 18, the app is legal to be used without consent in most US states. However, we do advise you to check with your local surveillance laws before using Xnspy. To use the app for employee monitoring, the employer must inform the employee. But using the app to monitor your partner, spouse, or any other person without their consent is outright illegal. The data gathered on the device uploads to Xnspy servers. The data can be accessed by the user only, and no one else. To view messages, call logs, contact list, multimedia files, emails, browser history, and other data collected on the device, log into your account. On the dashboard, you can see the device information, including the battery level, and location. On the left-hand side, the list of features is available. To view individual features, click the drop-down icon, and you will find each category of the features offered. Limited Time Offer XNSPY SOFTWARE IS INTENDED FOR LEGAL USE ONLY. XNSPY is a smartphone and tablet monitoring software designed for parents who wish to monitor their children under 18 years and employers who want to keep track of their employees through company-owned smartphones and tablets. The buyer of the XNSPY software must either own the smartphone or tablet or must have written consent from their children or employees. It’s illegal to use Xnspy for monitoring digital devices of your spouse, girlfriend/boyfriend, or partner. Failure to do so is likely to result in violation of applicable law and XNSPY will cooperate with the law-enforcing authorities to the full extent.

So you see, All your phone actions can be tracked along with the date and time print, With the help of a spy app which sits on your phone in an incog mode without giving you any signs that you’re being monitored. The famous ones are FlexiSpy, mSpy and Highster Mobile which proffers the Child monitoring, Employee monitoring and cheating Spouse apps with reasonable price and various versions to best suit the consumer. Although, It is very tough to detect these best android spy apps running on your device as the aforementioned popular spy software has improvised to a great extent; To not let the user know about the spy app by any means.

Depleted Phones Battery! – If your device’s battery is draining faster than normal then its a substantial clue for you to understand that there is some perpetual process running at the background which is using your phone’s battery life. Although all the powerful spy software has revamped this weak point in their software but the phones which are installed with the older versions can better relate with this sign to detect it.  Constant Cacophony In The Device! – The call record and listening feature available in the monitoring app leads to some disturbance when you make or take the phone call. Sometime this happens because of a poor connection but be careful if you hear some background noises every time during the phone calls, Perhaps the constant dissonance in the phone means that someone must be eavesdropping. Overblown Internet Usage! – All the monitoring apps are required to have a strong internet/WiFi connection to track the information in the form of log files. Hence the massive files can maximize the data usage of the monitored person’s cell phone. Although with the advanced and improved monitoring apps the data consumption is lowered and is only observable if large videos are getting transferred on the server. Messages From Unknowns! – Although, This glitch exists only in the indigent and poor quality spy software but sometimes the flash messages in the finest software can stand out to ensure you the monitoring apps existence in your mobile phone. The content in these text messages can just be a regular informatory text message or a message containing some rare symbols and numbers. There exist some programs that use the SMS to remotely execute the commands on the target user’s smartphone. iPhone is very easy and quick to check for any spyware installation. Yes!

Here, Perhaps you’ll be able to find the spy files. Although, With the advanced and hi-tech measures, It’s not a piece of cake to detect any of the spy or monitoring files in the phone’s managing application but if you find any file with some awkward name or in alphanumeric style then it might be a log file of the cell phone monitoring application. I suggest that DO NOT delete these suspicious looking files in haste, As you might delete some important directory or index file of your phone’s Operating System. And this may lead your cell phone to soft brick state. Hence, Examine about the file first and then remove it from your smartphone. So, Look for the aforementioned signs carefully to smoke out the presence of any spyware in your device.

Subsequently, you just need to make sure that the iCloud backup and syncing options for the account are enabled on their phone.

Putting a cell phone in your kids’ hands is a big step, and brings with it a lot of questions, concern, and trepidation. Am I giving it to them too soon? Are they going to be safe? How can I keep track of what they’re doing? While the decision of when, and if, to give your child their first cell phone is a personal one, there are some steps you can take to ensure their safety once you’ve made the decision. Cell phone tracking software is one of the best ways to keep taps of their smartphone activity, and two of the biggest names in the industry are Bark and mSpy, but which one should you choose? In the article, we’ll be comparing mSpy vs. Bark, so you can get a better idea of what each one brings to the table, how much they cost, and which one is going to be your best match. Our team of tech experts have put these two tracking softwares to the test – which one wins? Keep reading to find out: While both Bark and mSpy bring a lot to the table, they both work a little different, so let’s first take a look at their features and tracking capabilities, so if there’s once that may work better for you when compared to the other. We’ll start with Bark:  Since Bark (read review) first launched they say they’ve helped protect more than 5.2 million children, prevented 16 school shootings, and prevented 75,000 self-harm situations- those are some pretty impressive numbers. So how have they done all that? Here’s a rundown of how and what they track:  mSpy (read review) says their cell phone tracking software is the number 1 choice for parents looking for device control for their kids. Here’s a look at what mSpy offers: As you can see, both mSpy and Bark have a lot to offer, and put you in control when it comes to keeping tabs of your children’s cell phone activities. As far as we can tell, Bark is a bit more sophisticated, and has a few advanced features that you may appreciate when compared to mSpy. mSpy does alert parents when certain keywords are searched for online, but Bark’s alerts appear to be a bit more comprehensive. Two of the biggest advantages that put Bark ahead in this category? mSpy has some These are two big advantages, in my opinion. Want to learn more? Another factor that may help you decide if Bark or mSpy is the better choice for your tracking needs is the price for each app. While their pricing plans are fairly comparable, they both offer different plans and pricing tiers that are worth examining. Bark Pricing Options Bark offers two plans – their Bark Jr. plan is basically for people who just want to limit their child’s screen time, control which websites they can visit, and monitor their location. If you want to track everything we’ve detailed above, then you’ll want the regular Bark plan at $14 per month or $99 per year. Check current Bark pricing options – free trial currently being offered. mSpy Pricing Options mSpy offers a basic version of their app, and premium version. As is the case with Bark, you get a limited version of mSpy if you opt for their Basic version. If you want access to all of their features, then we recommend opting for their premium service. You can save money by paying for more months up front. Here’s a look at their pricing tiers: The best deal you can get on mSpy is by paying for full year up front. If you’re planning to track cell phone activity over an extended period of time, it may be worth it to opt for the yearly package. Another option is to try mSpy for a month, and then upgrade to the yearly plan if you decide you like it. When it comes to tracking your child’s smartphone activity, it’s good to know you have great options to pick from. At the end of the day, both Bark and mSpy can get the job done. You can’t go wrong either way, honestly, it just comes down to the features and pricing options you’re looking for. In my opnion, Bark takes the edge as being the slightly more complete option, and there a couple of reasons why: Think Bark sounds like a good fit? Kevin is the founder and editor for TechAwards.org.

        "body": "Falls du minderjährige Kinder hast oder verantwortlich für angestellte Mitarbeiter bist, möchtest du vielleicht aus verschiedenen Gründen über deren Umgang mit ihren Smartphones oder Tablets Bescheid wissen: mit wem sie sprechen, ob sie ihre Geräte oder das Firmenhandy (falls es sich um Angestellte handelt) angemessen nutzen, oder welche Informationen sie mit Dritten teilen. Die meisten Aktivitäten können dank des von mSpy angebotenen Dienstes überwacht werden, der speziell für die elterliche Kontrolle und Arbeitsumgebungen gemäß den entsprechenden gesetzlichen Regelungen entwickelt wurde. Daher ist es wichtig, Folgendes zu betonen: Seine Entwickler fördern oder übernehmen keine Verantwortung für eine Nutzung, die von diesen Bedingungen abweicht, wie z.B. die Verletzung von Arbeitsrechten, die Kontrolle eines Partners oder jeden anderen Fall, der einen Eingriff in das Recht auf die Privatsphäre einer Person beinhalten kann (wie in den Nutzungsbedingungen beschrieben). Nachdem wir dich also über diese Bedingungen gewarnt haben, verraten wir dir, dass das, was dieser Service bietet, ein Online-Kontrollfeld für mobile Geräte ist, von dem aus du Zugriff auf alle Arten von Daten und Informationen hast, die über das Gerät übertragen werden.Die Funktionsweise ist relativ einfach: Du musst die entsprechende APK für Android, die iOS-App oder den Installer auf den zu steuernden Computer herunterladen und dieser wird so konfiguriert, dass er Teil der Geräteliste wird. Finde absolut alles heraus, was auf einem mobilen Gerät oder PC passiert: vom Mitlesen von Mails bis zum Ausspähen von WhatsApp. Dieser Service ist nicht kostenlos, sondern bietet je nach Vertragslaufzeit und den zu steuernden Geräten (je nachdem, ob es sich nur um Smartphones oder auch PCs handelt) unterschiedliche Preise.

I am happy i worked with him and Anna and recommended his services I made a purchase of this product, but I had to switch, as they couldn’t provide any positive results, for my money. This certainly is not a reliable, means to access any device. However, I was able to come across a professional company online. They provided me with access to info from my kids device. Call their customer service.-1 251 255 58.28. Also on what’s app1 251 347 09.64. This company is fraudulent in their claims that the app would be \"invisible\". They are fully aware that if you have a device running Android 10 or higher this is simply not possible. However, they will NOT tell you this information upfront. I installed the app and found that the app icon is visible on my device. In addition, because it is highly visible it can be easily uninstalled. I tried hiding it in other apps that can disguise it as a calculator or lock it from being uninstalled but this rendered the app useless. So I contacted them less than 12 hours after installing the app on my device via chat for support. It was at this time that I was told that I could hide the app icon in a folder. I attempted to follow their instructions but was unsuccessful. So I opened a support email for further assistance and was told again to hide the app icon in a folder. When I sent video that this wasn't possible, I was told they were giving me their paid tech assistance for free to resolve the issue. The first thing tech support tells me is that it is not possible to hide the app icon on an Android 10. He doesn't even try to work on the phone. Instead he sends me to billing, whose response is \"Your issue will be escalated to our Billing Department. Our Billing Agents will contact you by email within the next several business days regarding your cancellation request. We appreciate your patience!\" They then respond via email with the youtube video to hide the app icon in a folder. Again. They are simply trying to run the time clock out on the 14 days they have to issue a refund. They admit that their app cannot do what is advertised on my device, and despite complying with all of their requests, they refuse to abide by their own terms and conditions and refund the money I am due. I had to switch from this company same, day I purchased. Their principles had no refund, policy and the app, shows nothing from the device I had paid for. I had been referred, to the service of Foilcopi, they provided me with access to the information that was needed. Simply send them a message on lnstagram. Very poor service and bad experience. Will always recommend RenaGriffine at InstaG. PEASE do not be fooled by these people. I was looking for an app that would monitor Snapchat on an IPhone without jailbreaking the phone. After hours of online research I found mspy. Many people had written about it being a good choice and capable of doing what I needed. The people that wrote these things must have been working for mspy, because they lied. On the mspy web page blog there was a post by mspy giving people specific directions to set up to monitor Snapchat on an Iphone without jailbreaking. In addition I went to the mspy chat and asked specifically if mspy is capable of doing this... the response was yes. I figured this was enough confirmation and gave them my money for a one year subscription. What followed was days of me trying to set this up on the target phone and MANY calls and online chats. It would not monitor a single thing on the phone even aside from Snapchat. Finally in another chat I again asked for help and finally got the truth in response. They told me that mspy is not able to monitor Snapchat without jailbreaking the phone. I went through the online procedures to explain how they mislead me and requested a refund. I received a reply saying they would not refund my money because my reason was classified as a personal dislike of the app and not covered under their refund policy. I finally was able to get a person on the phone and told him what the email said and explained to him that it was not a personal reason... it was the result of them scamming me into buying something I could not use. The person on the phone said that I already had their response and he couldn't help me but I could email them again. I told him I had been getting ignored and put off for a week and needed to speak to his supervisor. A supervisor named Alex called me and explained everything AGAIN. At first he said he had no record of the original chat saying yes (before I purchased meaning yes it would do what I needed) so they would not refund. Then I said even if that's true what about the false directions posted telling people how to monitor without jailbreak? He said if I could send a screenshot of this he would process the refund. I sent the screenshot. I received a reply that said it was still a personal reason but they would offer me a 30% refund and I could still use the software to monitor the device for the length I purchased. I guess they forgot that I told them IT NEVER MONITORED ANYTHING ON THE PHONE! To this lame offer I responded: This is NOT acceptable. THIS IS RIDICULOUS! I spoke with Alex on the phone. I was lied to by your chat person and the website that this would monitor Snapchat without jailbreak before I bought it. After days of not being able to get this to work I was told it would not work without jailbreak. You are liars and scammers. I have spent weeks trying to get you to do the right thing with emails and phone calls and you keep giving lame excuses and trying to avoid accepting responsibility. Alex told me when I provided the screenshot proving you mislead people online he would move forward with my refund. Instead you offer me 30% and the ability to continue using it to monitor... THIS NEVER WORKED... I AM NOT ABLE TO MONITOR ANYTHING! UNBELIEVABLE! If you do not give me the full refund I will post everything I mentioned here on every possible review site I can and report you to Better Business, Consumer Affairs, and anywhere else I can to warn people away from your lies and scams. I will post the screenshot where you lied and the chat where you tell me I can't use it without jailbreak. Refund my FULL amount! Now they are ignoring me. I have sent 2 more emails asking for the status of my refund and have gotten nothing. DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE YOUR MONEY! Get Outlook for Android Get Outlook for Android See Trustpilot reviews directly in your Google searches Their sales reps will promise you anything to get you to buy, but the SW is not able to do what is promised. They will even promise you a refund that will never come through. Not recommended. We had high hopes for this tech solution, and in spite of the high price tag ($119.99/year) decided to give it a try after reading numerous positive “reviews” online (will come to that later). However, after confirming device compatibility and spending over two hours with their tech support to install/setup the platform, it failed to work. We asked for a refund and were referred to the billing office, who did not respond. At this point it was Day 8 post-purchase, and the Mspy refund policy states “no refund will be issued after 14 days.” We reached out again, and finally did get a response from the Customer Care and Billing Manager who offered us a free 3-month extended subscription. Obviously we declined the offer on the grounds that 3 extra months would be of no use to us, since the product is non-functional. We reiterated our desire for a refund. Mspy responded and offered us some other product called mLite, which we had never heard of before. Again we asked for a refund. At this point Mspy offered us a 50% refund – which, incidentally, is not stipulated anywhere in their very long and ridiculous refund policy. Thereafter we made several more requests for a full refund, which were not answered. It was abundantly clear at this point that Mspy had no intention of giving us a refund – and it seemed to matter NOT AT ALL that we could not use their product, nor that we were dissatisfied customers. So we disputed the charge with our CC company. To our surprise, Mspy actually took the time to answer the dispute with a pile of their own evidence. But the evidence had nothing to do with the actual matter in question – the validity of our refund for a defective or otherwise non-usable product – but instead simply established the original transaction as authentic! Again, what’s so appalling here is that Mspy went out of their way to ensure they kept our money, knowing full well we could not use their product. I have never seen a legitimate company behave this way. Which leads me to believe that either A) Mspy is not, in fact, a legitimate company, or B) Mspy is a legitimate company with totally unethical business practices. The answer, most likely, is B. In addition to stonewalling customers who request refunds, I believe Mspy engages in suspect marketing practices. To be fair, I cannot prove this. But I find it highly suspicious, for example, that a Google search of “mspy reviews” yields page after page of glowing reviews from so-called tech blogs and other publications that, upon closer inspection, appear rather dubious. My hunch – and again, I cannot prove this – is that Mspy has paid for placement and/or fabricated the sites themselves. Regardless, what’s also quite apparent is they’ve cleverly employed SEO to drive these sites higher and bury any unwanted negative opinions. Unfortunately that means my review will likely never see the light of day … All this speculation aside, the truth is that Mspy not only seems to have total disregard for customer satisfaction, they have total disdain for any customer who wishes to amicably cut ties and get the refund they deserve. We may have been willing to give them another shot in the future, had they done the right thing. But now … here I am taking even more time out of my life to help prevent others from making the same mistake. I tend to believe “what goes around comes around.” Not sure how much bad karma $119.99 buys you these days, but I certainly hope Mspy gets it! From start to finish it has been nothing but a pleasure to deal with this website customer support and service. I am not very tech savvy so there are times when I need to ask advice or help and they have always guided me through. Thanks! And they always get the job delivered as soon as possible See: ha CK Er sp YV ille Mspy is a scam!!!! If I could give less than one star I definitely would. This company is nothing but a scam. They’ve taken my money and have refused to refund 100% of it. I have not received one iota of information from the company for the service that I paid for.Buyer beware do not purchase anything from this company. I am delighted I was referred by my colleague and I got my excellent job. In figure. Plus ONE (FIVE ZERO ONE) TWO NINE TWO FOUR NINE ONE TWO (T E X T) \"mspy.com\" and their many urls is a fake and scam company. Fake company with fake personalities will never ever refund you and will lie to you. The app is so bad it doesn't have useful features other than aesthetic colors. They will persuade you to make a purchase claiming that you can ask for refund, but in reality will never allow you to get a refund. Their \"billing department\" is nothing but waste time and will answer 3 days and even a week after each response. They do not intend to give any refund !!!! They claims are lies too ! saying that there is 3 days trial. Be sure it is nothing but a money scam they want your credit card to charge it and forget you! Look at these reviews. I have never seen a more blatant attempt to stuff reviews and ratings for any product. There are repeated reviews (word for word) from different users. There are other common signature features. What a joke! Clearly they are trying to manipulate their ratings. Very poor service and bad experience. Wont recommend it to anyone. The most disgusting things is seen someone you love cheating on you, i have got married to my husband for the past 6 years, suddenly i notice his strange attitude as he always glue to his phone unlike before, i try to figure out as i begin to suspect him before i finally encounter many articles about spy app from weespy.com that give me encouragement on what to do Claim your profile to access Trustpilot’s free business tools and start getting closer to your customers today!

Cell Phone Spy Reviews Comments Off on mSpy Review: Is mSpy Worth Getting? 6,511 Views Table of Contents mSpy is a popular cell phone tracking and monitoring app that can be used on iPhones and Android devices. According to their website, their mission is to: “Provide parents with effective tools to keep tabs on their kids’ online activities, protecting them and minimizing all potential dangers their kids may face online.” Using their app, parents can view their child’s phone activities remotely from their own devices. However, just like many other monitoring and spy apps, you will need access to the device in order to install it.    There’s a mixed bag of mSpy customers. Many have raved about the product, but a majority say it is not worth it. On resellerratings.com, mSpy has about 190 reviews, with a combined star rating of only 1 out of 5! Many of these negative reviews claim the following: Then on sitejabber.com, mSpy only has a rating of 2.85 stars from over 261+ reviews, with 165 of them being 1-star reviews. Clearly, most of mSpy’s customers are NOT fans of the product and company.  As an alternative option to mSpy, you should consider the top-rated cell phone spy app Auto Forward (which we highly recommend).  Try Auto Forward Today!    mSpy includes all of the features needed to monitor a child’s cell phone.    When you compare mSpy to Auto Forward, Auto Forward is clearly the best.  Try Auto Forward Today!   To learn more about Auto Forward, read our review.

        "body": "Don’t you feel insecure when sending your kids away to school or to their friend’s home? Or, what if, you have that gut feeling that your partner is lying to you? And, if you are running a company and not able to keep track of where your employees roam during office hours? These problems do raise a lot of concerns. So, why not consider Mspy for Phone tracker?  But the question is: What is Mspy for a phone tracker? And, what does it do? While you may be having a lot of confusion if you have not used a spyware before. So, let’s find out the answers that could help solve the problems that you usually have when it comes to securing the safety of your loved ones. Yes, Mspy can do that.  Mspy is a monitoring app that is also known as parental control solution for keeping tabs on your kids. However, you can also use the tracking software for other reasons too. Definitely, the ones talked in the beginning of this article. Without wasting much time, find out what the app is all about. And, how it could be helpful in tracking the target phone when required.  Without a pinch of doubt, Mspy is one of the best monitoring apps out there. And, that is because of the transparency and safety it offers to the users. Moreover, it has the best customer support system for ensuring that the users never have to wait for long when seeking assistance.  Mspy is a very comprehensive spyware that manages to put most of the crucial feature in front of users. You can choose between various packages and plans when subscribing for Mspy. It lets you track the target device, as well as, it helps in various other monitoring functionality. For instance, you can check call logs, messages, monitor social media activities, check IMs etc. It also has the keylogger feature that lets you find out the keys pressed by the target device. Moreover, you get to enjoy the seven days of free trial. On top of that, it does not even ask for your credit card details to make use of the trial plan.  As mentioned before, there are various plans. So, before starting to monitor the target device using Mspy, you must create an account with the Mspy website and pay for the selected subscription plan. While doing so, do not forget to enter the correct email address. Once the payment completes, you will receive an email regarding the activation code and confirmation of your payment. Then, you can get access to the target smartphone and use the link provided in the email to download the app on the phone. This is necessary for Android phones. However, if you wish to monitor iPhones, you can even go for the no-jailbreak plan. In this case, you can start monitoring by entering the iCloud details while registering online. Just ensure that the two factor authentication is turned off. Or else, you may need to check the code and access the target device for a minute or so. Once that is done, you can start tracking the location and other online activities using the dashboard.  Mspy, when it comes to tracking the phone, gives you plenty of options, starting from the usual location tracking to setting limits of travel for the target device. Check Real Time Location: Mspy phone tracking app offers fast data related to the real time location. Unlike many other similar apps, that fail to keep their promise when providing the exact location at any given time, this one serves the purpose very well. You can find out the exact location of the target device by logging into the dashboard. It lets you find out where the target phone is at any given moment.  In case, your phone is lost, you can use this feature to locate the device. And, if its stolen, the chances are high that you will find the culprit using the location tracking feature. Check Location History: Not just that, you can even check the different locations that the target device travelled for a given period of time. You just have to check the time logs to find that out. This way, you do not need to stay online with your dashboard to find out the different places the target phone visits in a day. All you have to do is, get the data for the entire day. And, the work is done.  Geofencing: There is one more thing to keep a close eye on the target device without bothering to check the online Mspy cell phone tracker dashboard every other minute. With geofencing, you can set the range for travel in a digital map. In case, the device leaves that set perimeter and moves out of the range, you will receive a notification for the same. So, unless the device stays within the range, you do not need to bother checking the real time location at all.  Now that you know that Mspy could provide very comprehensive details of the target device, it is no brainer to understand why is it so popular. From call logs to the actual location of the device, you can find out almost every crucial information related to the online activities. Hence, letting users keep their loved ones safe and sound.  Plus, you do have the option to check the functionality of the solution using their trial period. And, unlike other apps, that do not offer enough time to assess the app during the trial period, this one offers a complete week. What else could you ask for? Mspy for Phone tracking could become your ultimate solution for all the monitoring needs. Just remember to opt for the right plan that lets you accomplish your monitoring goals. As with any other app, Mspy also has different plans with varying capabilities. The expensive one offers all the features. And, you can even get huge discounts while there are offers running.

However, mSpy is widely regarded as one of the best, if not the best tools for tracking your phone.  In the following review, we will discuss why this is so. What makes mSpy so highly rated? What are the benefits of using this app? What are the disadvantages? Read on to find out more. mSpy Review With mSpy, you can monitor the way your child uses his cellphone. It is a monitoring tool that allows you to know what they are doing on their devices. Although the focus is on parental control, mSpy can be used in many other situations. For example, if you are suspicious your partner is cheating on you or engaging in nefarious activities, you can use this app to track what they do on their phone. Employers and organizations also use this software. Many employers complain about drops in productivity levels from their employees. One reason for this is the use of social networks and related apps by workers on company time. To monitor, and control the use of social media and related software by employees, many employers have resorted to using mSpy.  Features of mSpy GPS Tracking: How to track a phone has been a concern of many parents. Since kids are often inseparable from their phones, it is one sure way of knowing the exact location of your child. The mSpy software does several things in this regard. First it records the GPS location of your child's phone. Therefore, you can see his exact location on a map. It also sends you periodic updates to show where he is. View Call Log: The app allows you to monitor their calls. Although you cannot listen in to phone calls, you can get details like who called them, how long the call lasted, the timestamp of the call, and other details. Read messages and E-mails: mSpy allows you to tap into your child's phone to read any of their messages and e-mails. Even if the messages are deleted from the phone, mSpy can still retrieve these for your perusal. While testing this app, I discovered that you can link this feature to Gmail and other email clients. Record Keystrokes : mSpy allows users to uncover and record every single keystroke. You can use this to know the information your child has been sanding to others. This function is currently limited to Android devices. With it you can know things such as log in details, passwords, emails, and messages. Website Monitoring and Blocking: The Internet can be a very dangerous place, especially for inexperienced children. With this function, parents can monitor the websites their kids visit. Parents can also restrict access to websites that are dangerous and unwholesome for their children. These are just some of the best features that mSpy offers to users. During use, we found the application quite easy to install and set up.  How To Install mSpy It should be noted that the installation method differs from device to device. Installing the software on a Jailbroken IOS device requires a different method when installing on an IOS device that hasn't been tampered with. And the installation on an Android device is different from installation on IOS devices.  Furthermore, since mSpy comes in different packages, installation processes for each package varies. Regardless, of the differences the entire process are quick and easy. Is mSpy Detectable? The whole point of installing this app on another's phone is moot if it can be detected, right? Thankfully, during testing, I observed that the app is virtually undetectable. It did not appear on the app drawer list or even in the app manager. Furthermore, it did not drain the battery which could have led to suspicions. Pros Aside from the great features, customer support and technical assistance is incredible. Cons To enjoy the most advanced features, you need to pay for the premium package  Conclusion This app is the best spy app you can get, period. With great features and wonderful customer support, you can't go wrong with it. Sign up for our free newsletter for the Latest coverage! "

Monitoring tools can help parents safely watch their kids’ online activity and help business owners make workers more efficient. Besides, here are the full FamiSafe Review, Snoopza Reviews, and SpyHuman review for your reference. So, what is mSpy, and what makes it such a well-known spy tool? The simple answer would be time. mSpy was one of the first monitoring tools, and because it’s been around for so long, mSpy reviews find a lot of reasons to praise it. It is also a widely compatible monitoring software. Any device running Android 4 or later can be tracked, as can any iPhone using iOS 7 to iOS 15. These versions apply to devices that users don’t root or jailbreak (jailbroken iPhones can only use mSpy if they have iOS 7 – 8.4 or iOS 9.0 to 9.1). Regardless of the device, mSpy is capable of being run without detection. In addition, it instantly starts to run as a background process, and hiding the app icon is easy too. After installing mSpy, there’s a lot of data that it tracks. Basic data types include SMS text, calls, emails, and documents. Furthermore, the more impressive features are GPS tracking, voice recording access, and access to media. Now, let’s look at the balance between pros and cons. Try mSpy Now Also, if you wonder How to stop mSpy from spying on you, click to read more. And here are the full Spyzie review for your information. There are a number of concerning downsides to using mSpy, and of avoiding these, an alternative is necessary. Two other spy apps to consider are KidsGuard, and they’re both perfect to use in place of mSpy. A favorite of ours is KidsGuard, and that’s the first spy tool that most mSpy reviews don’t bring as often as they should. There aren’t many things that KidsGuard isn’t capable of tracking. As a result of almost every smartphone activity being trackable, it would be a mistake not to try it out. This list of features goes on and on, and it’s more than impressive. By checking out the free online demo, users can get a closer look at what KidsGuard does and how it works. It’s obvious that KidsGuard is a strong alternative to mSpy and is suitable for tracking anyone. To assist you with setting up KidsGuard, we’ve put together a short guide. Installing KidsGuard on an iPhone is different but remains an easy task. Above all, the main difference is that you will require the iCloud account of your target, and without the email address and password, tracking iOS devices using KidsGuard isn’t possible. That being said, since parents usually set up their kids’ iCloud accounts, this shouldn’t be too hard to do. Try KidsGuard Also, if you wish to know more about Phonespector, Spyic, or FamilyTime, here are the completed Phonespector Review, Spyic Review, and FamilyTime reviews. mSpy is a great piece of monitoring software; we won’t deny that. However, we believe KidsGuard can be more effective than mSpy, and after you take the time to use them and explore their features and how they work, we think you’ll agree. Many mSpy reviews ignore the negatives of the popular monitoring solution. Instead, we choose to embrace all the positives and negatives, which allow us to be as objective as possible. The spy tools above are great for monitoring them all for children, employees, or even potentially cheating partners! Track locations, messages, calls, and apps. Do it remotely and 100% discreetly."

        "body": "Home » Apps » Spyzie Vs mSpy: Which Monitoring App Should You Choose? As an Amazon Associate and affiliate of other programs, I earn from qualifying purchases. Most parental control and spying apps have the same basic features. At the bare minimum, they can access location, view call logs and browser history, and block apps on the target device. That said, not all apps are created equal. In fact, out of all the tracking apps available today, Spyzie and mSpy are two of the most popular – due to their reputation, pricing, and features. But in the battle of the best spying and tracking app on the market today, which one is the winner?  While mSpy seems to be the clear choice in terms of features, pricing, and customer satisfaction, Spyzie is also great in its own way.  That’s why, in today’s detailed Spyzie vs mSpy comparison, we’ll tell you everything you need to know to help you decide which one you should choose! Contents [hide] Spyzie is an app that allows users to access and control a target device remotely. It was created by a company named SuperSoft Limited, a company established in 2007 that specializes in various software.  Despite the app’s simple and straightforward appearance, it actually comes with plenty of professional features. You can view call logs, GPS location, messages, and website history, among many other things. Get Spyzie Now! Even if you’re not a very tech-savvy person, Spyzie is quite easy to install and set up. There’s no need to hack, root, or jailbreak the target device before you can install the app.  In fact, you can install the app on almost any device running iOS or Android, as long as the OS version is supported. It doesn’t even have any demanding tech requirements, as just 512 MB of RAM is enough for it to run. For Android phones, you need to physically have the device in order to install the app, rooted or not. For iPhones though, you only need the target device owner’s iCloud ID and password in order to gain access.  You should also make sure that two-factor authentication is turned off since Spyzie isn’t able to access devices with 2FA enabled. Once you get Spyzie linked to the device, however, you can then view the data from your online control panel on the Spyzie website anytime you want.  Get Spyzie Now! What makes Spyzie stand out is that it also allows users to take live screenshots and set up Smart Capture. This means that users can view whatever the target user is seeing on the target device at any point in time, as long as the device is unlocked.  With Smart Capture, it can also take automatic screenshots based on a specific trigger. So far, there are no other tracking apps on the market that have this feature. Read more about features in our comprehensive review. Get Spyzie Now! When it comes to pricing, Spyzie is also pretty straightforward. In fact, there are only two plans offered, the Pro plan and the Ultimate plan. The Pro plan is priced at $49.99 for one month and $69.99 for three months.  The Ultimate plan, which comes with a few upgrades, such as real-time alerts, timeline, and data export, is priced at $59.99 for one month and $79.99 for three months.  Both plans can only be used on just one device at a time, so if you’re thinking of using Spyzie on different devices, you’ll need to purchase multiple plans. Unfortunately for all interested users, Spyzie hasn’t been accepting new registrations since March or April, ever since the COVID-19 pandemic first broke out.  It’s actually unclear whether the reason for this is the pandemic or not, but for now, it seems like the only thing that can be done is to look for an alternative app. Get Spyzie Now! Just like Spyzie, mSpy is also a spying application that can be used to monitor and control your chosen target device. It is actually one of the most popular tracking apps out there and is one of the top brands for spying apps. The app was first released by a London-based company back in 2010, albeit with only a few features, like GPS tracking and access to messages and call logs. Now, 10 years later, mSpy is one of the biggest names in the spying and tracking apps industry. As with Spyzie, there’s also no need to root or jailbreak the target device in order to install mSpy.  All you need is the phone’s iCloud login details if you’re installing the app on a non-jailbroken iOS device, and physical access if you’re installing on a jailbroken iPhone or an Android device. Installation is also quite straightforward and should take no more than 15 minutes.  That said, you do get more features if you’re installing the app on a rooted or jailbroken device, so if you want to get the most out of the service, you might want to consider this. Do keep in mind that rooting or jailbreaking a device that is still under warranty will void the warranty. Currently, its features include geofencing, website blocking, and keylogging, in addition to the ones mentioned above. Its blocking features are what really make it shine though, due to how comprehensive they are.  Most other apps like this can only block phone numbers and apps at most, but mSpy can also block websites. It can even be set up to block apps only for specific hours of the day, which is helpful for controlling your child’s app usage. Curious to know more? Read the rest in our full review. If you want to avail of a plan from mSpy, you’ve got several options. You can opt for the Basic plan at $26.99 for 1 month, $59.99 for 3 months, and $99.99 for 12 months.  The Premium plan, which comes with a lot more features, is $69.99 for 1 month, $119.99 for 3 months, and $199.99 for 12 months.  If you’re thinking of tracking multiple devices at once, the Family Kit package is the best way to go, at $359.97 for 6 months and $479.97 for 12 months. With this package, you can install mSpy on up to three devices at once.  mSpy and Spyzie can both be installed on non-rooted and non-jailbroken devices, as well as rooted and jailbroken devices.  If your iOS device is not jailbroken, you only need the phone owner’s iCloud login details to gain access to the device. For Android devices and jailbroken iOS devices, you need to have physical access to the phone to install either app. Winner: Both apps are pretty easy to install, but Spyzie’s installation process for Android is a bit more complicated, so mSpy is the winner here. You can use the GPS tracking feature on both apps to track the physical location of the target device and set up restrictions based on that.  Not only can you view the target’s current whereabouts, but you can also see all the places visited by the target device recently. You can even view details about the visit, such as date and time. Winner: This feature on either app is very similar, so it’s a tie. For Android users, there’s an option in both apps to allow the keylogger to track all keystrokes on the target device.  Through this tool, you’ll be able to see all login details and passwords typed on the device. Every single action that is taken on the target device will be logged and sent to the apps’ online dashboards. Winner: It’s a tie since both apps have the exact same feature. Social media tracking is another feature that many spying apps have, including mSpy and Spyzie. Supported platforms in both apps include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and more. mSpy, though, made our list of best IG spying apps. Spyzie’s tracking comes in the form of live screenshots, so you can see exactly what the target owner is seeing on the target device. Meanwhile, mSpy’s tracking comes in the form of texts, which doesn’t provide as much information as Spyzie’s. Winner: Spyzie and mSpy can both track activity on social media platforms, but Spyzie can actually take a screenshot of the screen, so it wins this round. If you want to know who’s been calling on the target device, you can do so by viewing the call logs on the online dashboard of either mSpy and Spyzie. Full details, like name, phone number, date and time, and call duration are accessible on both dashboards. If you don’t want the number calling the target device, you also get the option on the dashboard to block the number. Winner: The two are pretty much equal in terms of call log access, so it’s a tie again in this aspect. If there’s anything you don’t like happening on the target device, both apps give you the ability to block them. For instance, both Spyzie and mSpy can block suspicious apps and unknown callers. Both can also set time restrictions for apps if they want to control app usage on the target device.  However, mSpy is the only one who gives users the ability to block inappropriate websites, which Spyzie isn’t capable of doing, at the time of writing. Winner: Due to the additional ability to block inappropriate websites, mSpy is the clear winner here. mSpy’s pricing starts at $26.99 a month for one iOS or Android device, while Spyzie’s pricing starts at $49.99 a month for one iOS or Android device, which is quite steep.  Both apps also offer longer-term plans as well, although Spyzie only offers up to three months at a time, while mSpy offers up to 12 months, giving you maximum savings.  Lastly, mSpy has packages that allow users to install the app on up to three devices. Spyzie doesn’t have a similar product offering. This means that if you’re planning to track multiple devices at once, you’ll need to purchase a separate plan for each one. Winner: A $20 difference in price is a pretty big deal in our opinion, so mSpy wins this round. Plus, mSpy is simply cheaper in the long run since it offers a 12-month plan and even has packages for multiple devices. Also, as long as the target device is unlocked, Spyzie has the ability to take virtually unlimited screenshots. mSpy doesn’t have a feature that is even remotely similar to this, as of this writing. Getting an alert about a sim card change means that somebody found the phone and may not be planning to return it. Again, mSpy doesn’t have this feature yet. mSpy doesn’t have a feature like this, though we don’t consider this a major advantage since mSpy’s dashboard is already pretty comprehensive in our opinion. Sadly, if the target user created their account after the iOS 10 update with 2FA already enabled, there’s no way to turn it off. This means that Spyzie will only be able to access their call logs and browser history, nothing more. Once you unlink it, the app will be totally removed from the device, with or without the target user’s knowledge. For Spyzie, however, you’re going to need physical access to the device again if you want to uninstall the app.  If you’re looking for an app that can help you monitor your family’s device activity, both mSpy and Spyzie are decent choices.  That said, while these two products have plenty of similarities, they do stand out in their own special way.

        "body": "Security for All Devices - Sisecure Sisecure.com  Try mSpy Try Cocospy More and more kids are using their smartphones to access their study materials while on the move. In their free time, they use it to browse the internet, visit social networks, and exchange WhatsApp or messenger messages with their friends. However, they often fall prey to online cheaters and befriend them. It can lead to dangerous outcomes if not tackled in time. Employees take advantage of their internet-enabled mobiles to chat with their colleagues and meet them when they should be running errands for their office. Although most of them are innocent, some of them often gather information about the latest information about new projects being researched in your office and pass it on to your competitors. The drop in the prices of smartphones and low-cost internet access has changed the way people access the internet. More than 75% of people use their smartphones to access the internet while on the move.   Would it not be great if you had an option to eavesdrop on their chats, find out the details of their incoming and outgoing messages, as well as find out their list of contacts?      The good news is that you can depend on spyware — a small application that runs on their mobile — to pass on all information to you. Such programs enable you to track the locations your employees and kids have visited, their activities on Facebook and other social networks. Such applications also allow you to: • Keep tabs on your employees • Keep an eye on your kids Since spyware does not appear in the list of installed apps, it is impossible to detect their presence on the target phone. Although you have a wide range of spyware to select from, I shall discuss two of the most popular ones in this mSpy vs Cocospy 2021 comparison to determine which is better. It will help you determine which one you should go for.       Users often end up being more confused, determining which application to use in an era when the spy app scene is overcrowded. In such a scenario, Cocospy stands apart from the rest as it is user-friendly and boasts of powerful features.    Try Now   Let me check its features to find out what makes it stand apart from the others. Like all popular spy apps, this one too allows you to access all data of the target phone with your favorite browser. What makes this app stand apart from the rest is that you do not need to jailbreak or root the target smartphone to install it to access its advanced features such as GPS tracking or social media monitoring. Like all professional spy applications, Cocospy uses stealth technology. It means that the app runs in the background without the user of the device being aware of it. Since the company does not store the data of the targeted device on their servers, there is no danger of anyone accessing it, a feature lacking in most such apps. There might be occasions when you want to uninstall the app from the device on which it is installed. For example, you have caught an employee stealing your sensitive data and passing it on to your competitors. You can perform the uninstallation process without the employee being aware of it with a single click on the control panel. I was surprised by the incredible list of features this app boasts of. It tracks everything on the target device: • Check contact book: You can view contact names, job info, addresses, phone numbers, display pictures, and much more • View SIM card details: View the mobile's IMEI number and information of the network carrier. You also have the option to receive an alert when the user of the target phone changes SIM cards by entering your email on the SIM card page of the user's portal of the application. • View calendar events: Stay a step ahead of the person using the target mobile and check his plans such as a travel date or a business meeting. You can further view all calendar entries. • Track location: Are you worried where your child is right now? This app uses the inbuilt GPS of the target device to provide you details about its location history and access information such as geographical coordinates and addresses.      • Check browser history: Cocospy provides you with details of the browser history of the device on which you have installed it, inclusive of websites, most visited websites, timestamps, and mini-website descriptions. If required, you can block the target device from accessing inappropriate sites. • View media files: Check the audio clips, pictures, and videos the target phone contains. Cocospy can also provide details of the media files that your kids or employees are sharing with their contacts. • View call logs: You can use this app to view comprehensive call logs along with contact information and timestamps. It also provides you with details of the five most popular callers. You can use this information to determine who your target calls most often. • Read messages: You can read the outgoing and incoming messages of the target mobile. Cocospy can also read iMessages of iOS devices. I was surprised to note that I could also retrieve deleted messages.   Ease of installation was one of the primary factors I wanted to check during this Cocospy versus mSpy evaluation. You need access to the target device to install this app on an Android-based mobile. You first need to change the configuration under settings to allow the installation of third-party apps to install this app.      In the case of iOS devices, you do not need to install the app on the target smartphone. You only require the iCloud credentials of the same. Once installed, you can remotely spy on the target phone by logging on to your account on Cocospy's website and selecting the device whose information you want to see. If you are not sure about how the app works, click on the “demo” link on the vendor's website.   You can use the “Geofence Alert” feature of the app to set up virtual zones on the map through the online console. You can mark a zone as forbidden or watched on the map. You will receive a warning the moment the target enters the forbidden zone or leaves it. The subscription charges are as follows:   For Android devices: • Basic pack, which does not have all features, costs $9.99 per month for a single device when you pay for the annual plan of $119.99 • Premium pack that has all features costs $49.99 per month for a single device • The family pack has all the features of the Premium pack. It costs $69.99 per month, with the sole difference being that you can use it on three devices   For iOS devices • Family pack, which does not have all features, costs $99.99 per month for five devices • Premium pack that has all features costs $10.83 per month for a single device when you pay for the annual plan of $129.99. • The business pack has all the features of the Premium pack and costs $399.99 per month, with the sole difference being that you can use it on 25 devices   There are other plans available too that you can check on the vendor's website. I was, overall, pleased with it. However, I still need to compare mSpy and Cocospy to find out which one is the king.   Like all good spy applications, mSpy too comes with many features that allow you to spy on your kids, and staff silently.    Try Now   You may have wondered as to why there is a drop in productivity levels from your employees. It may be that they are spending more time surfing the internet and chatting with their friends rather than doing their work. Since I have already mentioned details of spy applications and what they do, I shall jump straight into the features of this awesome spy application. Like Cocospy, this one also has versions for Android and iOS-based mobiles. Installing this app requires a different method to install on a jailbroken iOS device and one that has not been tampered with. For installing on Android devices, you have to change the settings to allow the installation of apps from third-party developers. Like any good mobile spy app, mSpy cannot be detected by the user of the target device.      Let us check the features of this app. • Website blocking and monitoring: You can use this function to monitor the websites your employees and kids visit. Also, you have the option to restrict access for your kids to dangerous websites. Your employees will be bewildered when they try to access certain websites only to find that they cannot gain access to it. Since mSpy does not show up on the list of running applications, they will not be aware that you are blocking them from accessing it. • Keystroke recording: mSpy allows you to record every keystroke on the installed device. This feature is extremely handy to find out the details your employees or kids have been sending to others. This feature is available for both Android and iPhone (iOS) versions of the app.      • Read emails and messages: The app allows you to tap into your child/employee's mobile to read messages, including received and sent SMSs along with their time and date. You can also read deleted messages, which is a handy feature. The app can also monitor messages sent and received via several third-party messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger along with information about the recipient and sender. You can also read emails sent and received through the target phone. The best part is that you have the option of linking this feature to all email clients, including Gmail. • View call log: You can retrieve information such as details of the person who called on the target device, the timestamp, as well as the duration of the call along with other information. • GPS tracking: The application records the GPS location of the installed device, allowing you to see its exact location on a map. It also sends you periodic updates about the precise location of the device. I loved the periodic update of this app. It gathers data every five minutes and displays the same on the control panel of the vendor's website, which you can access via any browser. Another vital and exclusive feature of this app is its ability to work on non-jailbroken iOS devices.      You can use it to track and show messages sent or received via Google Hangouts, including photos, maps, and contact details. The other popular messaging platforms that mSpy tracks include: • iMessage • Kik • Instagram • Line • Snapchat • Skype • Telegram • WhatsApp • Viber, and • Tinder   Mspy also allows you to see the details of installed and available apps on the target mobile. You can use its “Block App” feature to restrict the usage of unwanted apps. I did not notice such a feature on Cocospy.      The keystroke logger stores a record of all keystrokes on the target smartphone, and you can view the same through the online control panel. Like Cocospy, you can rely on mSpy to track the activities of the browser on the installed mobile, which includes browsing history as well as bookmarked websites. You can also track specific keywords and key phrases and receive an alert the moment the user of the installed device types them. I give a higher ranking to this app as it allows you to establish smart screen time rules and block inappropriate websites. Unlike Cocospy, mSpy identifies and tracks all the WiFi hotspots the mobile was connected to and provides detailed information such as name, duration, and type. You also have the option of blocking suspicious hotspot connections. Like any professional spy app, mSpy allows you to view the address book of the installed smartphone or tablet, including contact details. The vendor allows you to try the application before you buy it by creating an account. You have to enter your email address on their website to create the account. They also have a demo page where you can view a simulation of the app.   To round up this mSpy compared to Cocospy article, I would like to state that I preferred mSpy because of its additional features like the “Block App”, as well as its price. Track your loved ones, staff, or kids today with the help of mSpy or Cocospy. Try mSpy Try Cocospy Filed Under: Parental Control COPYRIGHT © 2021 · SISECURE.COM"

It offers a wide range of mobile tracking options and to some extent it is the most popular software application among its competitors. It is remarkable for the set of advanced features as well as a unique ones such as Keylogger. 3.8. /5.",
        "body": "As any other software of the kind, mSpy allows tracking location of your target via GPS. It is easy to use and it helps a lot. mSpy allows blocking the undesired incoming calls. However, it does not allow blocking the number but getting the information about the incoming/outgoing calls and requests concerning the forbidden number. Here is no option in mSpy for making such notifications. mSpy is known to offer a quite speedy support in case a client needs it. Their support team is ready to answer to any inquiries 24/7. They also have free number where they can be reached easily in case of any problems. They also offer Live Chat support. Among the similar applications mSpy can be considered as the one having exceptional support team. This application price starts from $25.49 for a Basic 1-month package and it is $69.99 for a Premium 1-month subscription. You can also get a Bundle kit (mobile+desktop) for $72.24 a month. This software cannot be called cheap by any means; however, for those users looking for the best quality and extended range of features, it will be the choice worth making.  The company is mentioned in kidSAFE Seal Program.  Consumer reviews can be found at trustpilot.com mSpy can be characterized as a very useful and easy to handle application for mobile tracking. It offers a broad range of features and it works in stealth mode and in accordance to the feedbacks studied, no faults were discovered. Visit mSpy: https://www.mspy.com/   I heard a great deal about this service and eventually I decided to give it a try – there was a need, to put it in such a way. I have to say that it is really undetectable – I was relieved to get this confirmed. I also like it that the data is unloaded in small packages and it is just impossible to be detected and there is no text commands that are used in other software and all the control goes from the control panel – strictly online. Not a chance that you get this mentioned on your cell bill. I had just one issue with mSpy when I first installed it – calls were not recorded. However, with the help of their tech support it was resolved really in a matter of an hour. I surely can recommend mSpy as it served my purposes well at some point of y life. It is absolutely sure that you are going to be discouraged by the price of the app; however, as for me – I would rather pay more and even double but deal with the faultless service. I do not trust cheap and easy solutions and, thus, mSpy is my choice . It’s too bad I haven’t learned about this very app earlier. It could be so much of help in my situation. I am absolutely positive now that paying double price is worth the features and options offered and I can recommend it to anyone, for sure. I totally AGREE with you. Target phone stayed disconnected from apt over a month. They lied about fixing the issue right up to the expiration date. SHAME ON YOU mSpy. Used the software for a year on an Iphone 4s. Had to many issues. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn’t. Tech support always said they are working on it and after 8 months, it never got resolved. The just say they are working on it and never resolve the problem. Once they get your money, good luck with support. Such a disappointment, really. I was promised that the product would work perfectly – and it did, but not perfectly. I think that for their price their support could have been better as well. No instant messaging tracking (requires rooting) and not declared at purchase time No email or event tracking working No Keyboard logs working It gave me 50% of what was claimed Help Desk and support is below average I have tried some apps before like spybubble & spyagent. Compared both apps that ive tried before i just want to say that mSpy deserved its #1st place ranking as the best mobile spy apps. I can trace whatever i want it like photos, contacts, locations, videos, web history, even whatsapp & facebook track. Yes, we have to root our mobile phone but android rooting is not an issue anymore because you can do that your ownself & it is easy to learn & root your mobile phone. Perfect, But Web Control Panel is not good. It is not really cheap. So I use SpyApp now, it cheap and the same with mSpy IT’S A BEAUTIFUL PROGRAM I have no idea why so many bad reports here. It works fairly well with me. Sometimes it looks like gps tracker got led astray but it’s fairly rare. Other featues are fine. I purchased it recently for my eldest kid, I got desperate fighting about where he goes and people hangs out with. The more I pressed the worst it got so I came up with this tracking app and I am glad I did. Saved me from so many headaches. Among the spy apps I tried, this one was the best so far. I haven’t been using it for more than a month so far but not a single problem occured. I bought the app to keep an eye on my eldest son – I am glad I did. No more bikering and I know where to find him when I need it without problems. The older they get, the harder it is to keep them from their devices. I got tired of trying to make my kids pay attention to what they do online and also of being worried all the time of where they are and so on. With mSpy things are so much easier – I know where my kids are and what websites they visit. I have already blocked a couple successfully without quarrels and shouting why they are not supposed to be visited – they just fail to connect and give up finally. I do recommend this app for parents of teens in the first place. Looks like only good feedbacks are here but I agree – the app is one of the best. I tried mSpy and Mobistealth and the first one proved to be more effective to me. Not that the latter is bad or does not work but in the long run I became confident in my choise of mSpy because its keylogger feature is really great. I worked well with my kids, it is really worth the money spent. Had great luck with software but target phone was reset. Re- Installation has been a nightmare because I can’t get the sim toolkit off. It won’t allow me to reinstall without removing it first. Too bad they cancelled these features, they were of use… However, this is really the best app I ever tried and not a single trouble in my entire experience. Mspy was top of the line before the call and surround recording ended. As far as internet browser tracking there is not a spyware available to track incognito browsing. So unless you are willing to root the target phone Mspy is like all the other spyware available if you want to track facebook, chat, email. I am into my 2nd yr with Mspy and it will be my last because now it’s definitely not worth the price now. Cancelled already cause the 2 features that i only used were cut off so there is no point on paying all that money for something i can get cheaper or that i wont be using… I disagree. The price you pay is well worth it, other applicaitons are just crap. They are, really. It’s the most of what you can get if your compare it with others. Mspy didn’t do what it promised. No sound recording of surroundings, and at first every SMS was listed as coming from just one person. Then it quit doing anything altogether after three days. But customer support did refund my money after it quit working. I loved MSpy and the surround recording was epic! Why they got rid of the best and most tempting feature is beyond me. I renewed without realizing that and was refused a refund. No other spyware seems to have this same feature. I’ve seen apps that record calls. Apps that record surroundings, but require a secret text be sent- Um, no. I just want my old MSpy back. 🙁 I have used it for two years now and despite the fact that tehy removed the features that were the most fun it is still the best spy app I’ve tried. MSpy is detectable by CM Security. Please advise on how to resolve it. I guess you’d better discuss it with the support, it is supposed to be undetectable. mspy is woow but i dont know how to instal I have used mspy for a month now and I have a serious concern over its usage. The battery of the phone drains so quickly that it is sure to leave the other person in suspicion. An average with quality but pretty bad in terms. It’s a good app but some other options that mspy don’t have that other free apps (android version of Android lost) have is sound recorder and ability to take pictures or video… that’s the reason why I’m only using it for one month then after that it’s kinda nonsense to keep dishing out $60 bucks a month or what ever it is for 12 months. PROS: is the ability to monitor whatsapp, facebook, snapchat,line and other social apps and the keylogger (IF I get it working), battery life on iphone 6+ is great from 100% in the morning to 70% by days end. CONS: no picture and no AUDIO or video recording (major disappointment ), gps traking is not live takes about roughly 10-15 min regardless if you set to report gps every 5 min. Other reports are hit and mis between 5- 10 min between changes of information, on text messages or emails it doesn’t show attachments. There are many problems in major features .. * in call logs many of logs appears as a number instead of contact name. * in some devices i tried, the video loges does not work at all. * in photo logs, it does not specify source of the photo ( if it is captured or downloaded or sent to mobile ) * in browser history, it does not detect logs from many browsers such as google chrome. * in Whatsapp logs it does not show names, only numbers and in whatsapp groups you can’t even know how sent messages, all that you may know is the incoming and outgoing messages. * the mspy does not have features like capturing photos or surrounding sounds. * best of mspy is the keylogger that detect every typing process in mobile even in calculator. I like the app but the one feature that is severely lacking is location detection. I had a different app that updated every 8 minutes but this app sometimes takes days! Mspy please contact me and tell me you fixed it! They won’t contact you unless you contact them first. Good luck talking to support Hi, can you please advise how you can hide the mspy icon? I’m about to buy this software but I cannot have the icon on the target phone. Also, do I need to root the android for access to WhatsApp, Facebook and email? Thanks, Mspy is not the best I’ve ever tried, maybe the most expensive… They spend a lot in publicity so that’s why is that popular. Facebook, Instagram, Line doesn’t update. Locations are not accurate. And, it is the most expensive service compared to other brands. Oh, by the way… customer service not a great thing, online chat hidden and they want uyou to pay for the support. Is this app hidden on target phone? Does it log 2nd party apps messages like Facebook messenger? Can I change how frequently the GPS tracks to save on the target phones battery life? You can hide it, and you get access to Facebook all right…thought, sometimes it get problems with updates. Had it for over a year worked fine and with the last IOS update, it plain just does not work. You contact their customer NO SUPPORT attempt to tell them they have an issue and after an hour of them telling you they don’t have an issue, they agree, they do have an issue. It keeps defaulting back to a previous IOS version therefore it won’t work. Even when you uninstall the phone, it only gives you one version to update to. The old version. Don’t buy this product thry have serious issues. Location services worked for a day. Now it isn’t working. My spy tell me everything is fine on there end. Was working great. Customer service blew me off saying the problem in on my end. Not sure what to do. Can anyone help with this problem… If you don’t root the phone you won’t get many features, but even the ones you get sometimes it doesn’t update for hours. Kinda disappointed Right, their updates seem to never be in a hurry. Good Well, it helped me a lot. Is it hidden on target device I want to purchase it I want to purchase this I would like to know how many phones can be targeted and is rooting reqd. perfect Current version monitors SnapChat if: 1. You jail break the phone 2. You are on iOS 9 or earlier Current iOS is 11 with 12 already planned to be released. MSpy is going to release jail break for iOS 10 soon. Unless your child knows nothing about their phone and never updates it, SnapChat monitoring is impossible. This company is very customer unfriendly. Don’t fall for this. Terrible service, support and dishonesty… I needed help with monitoring snap chat. The customer support told me rooting would only take a few minutes with some support. I bought the product. Then they told me it would not work with a Verizon phone. I asked for a refund. They countered with fine print and offered products I don’t need. Dont buy from these thieves. Does not work with latest April 2018 version of iOS 11. Per the tech support chat that I just had, mSpy is not compatible with any version newer than iOS 9.1, as there is no “full jailbreak” for newer versions. Not helpful if you have 3 year old or newer phones!!! bought the no-jail break version. After it took a really long time to install and then 24 hours later finally being able to look at what was downloaded the day before, it no longer did update. Was not a password problem, even though customer support would like insist it is. Was told to unlink and relink phone. After you do that, wait another 24 hours to see if it worked. It did not not. Tried that multiple times. SO all in all, a useless software and pointing to fine print they claim they don;t have to refund my money. BUYER BEWARE. with this company, you will have to read FAQ, contact (not sure it was ever displayed ding purchase) and basically every word on their website to see of you really want/need the software. I do not recommend it! I purchased the mspy product to monitor my teenage son who was hanging out with the wrong crowd. After several attempts to disable the 2-factor authentication feature on his iphone – even after mspy’s suggestions – I asked for a full refund. To date, all I got are the same emails giving the same suggestions and lately, an email saying I was getting half a refund…REALLY? I sent an email demanding my FULL refund and haven’t heard from them AT ALL. I check my credit card account EVERYDAY and haven’t received a cent back. Despite the reviews, they must be doing bad because they can’t find a way around giving me back my $68.98. Do not expect any help from customer service. They actually hung up on me mid-sentence. Tech support told me my appt time to root phone was 6-7 when clearly my confirmation e-mail stated 11-12. I could go on and on. But i’ll only get angry again. In closing mspy sucks and cant do what they claim. I can’t rate them in negative numbers so i’ll leave that part blank. You’ve been warned. I live chatted to a sales staff member and asked specific questions about the installation process and weather I would have to change a bunch of settings while installing (because I couldn’t get a hold of the target device for long so I needed to know exactly what I was doing) the sales staff member completely and utterly lied to almost every specific question I had. I even asked if I have to turn google play protect off (step one by the way according to the installation process guide I seen after I had purchased) and the staff member said no. The staff member said I just have to install the file and that’s it, completely lied. I have been asking for a refund of my $92 (my currency) for 5 days now and they are just giving me the run around and saying via email the billing team will be in contact within 48 hours. I have never installed on any device and want nothing to do with this lying company and just want a refund but when they did contact me they said we can offer you assistance in installing for free. I don’t want any free services I want a refund. After reading all the bad reviews on here it seems I’m not the only one they do this too. Avoid this company, the sales staff either don’t know what they are doing and give you false information or they knowingly lie to make a sale that is then impossible to get a refund back from. pessimo programa paga a te o suporte tecnico e nao funciona e nao responde direito, nao comprem!!!!!!

Learn more By Mike Williams last updated September 20, 2021 MSpy excels at monitoring instant messages, texts and how a phone is being used. But if you're after a true parental controls app, something to control screen time, internet access and more, there are far cheaper and more powerful solutions around. MSpy excels at monitoring instant messages, texts and how a phone is being used. But if you're after a true parental controls app, something to control screen time, internet access and more, there are far cheaper and more powerful solutions around. MSpy is a hugely powerful phone monitoring app which can report on almost every area of your kid's online activities (and one or two of the offline ones, too.) Need to monitor calls, for instance? No problem. Looking to check text messages? That's included, too (you can even view deleted texts.) And mSpy's Android app can log conversations on all the top messaging apps and platforms: WhatsApp, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, iMessages, Skype, Telegram, Viber and many more. You're able to monitor your child's browsing history, see their bookmarks and the Wi-Fi networks they've used to get online. The Android app can block access to websites by category, and setting up keyword alerts help you see if they've accessing inappropriate content. MSpy's app manager keeps you up to date with everything you've installed. On Android, you can also block inappropriate apps, or use a screen recorder and keylogger to see exactly what your kids are doing. Android-only location features include the option to highlight your device on a map. Geofencing support allows you to define key areas in your child's life (home, school, grandma's house) and get alerts when they arrive and leave. And the feature list goes on, with options to log incoming and outgoing emails, track your child's contacts, watch their calendar, see the pictures they send and receive, read their notes, and more. Beware, though: although mSpy tells you a lot about how a device is used, it has very few features to control usage. You can't limit screen time or device usage, and there's no way to block websites or apps by category. It's far more about surveillance than all-round parental controls.  MSpy's monthly billing is a gut-punching $49 for the first month, $70 on renewal. How many devices does that cover, you're asking? Just one. (Sorry.) Signing up for longer does get you huge savings. The three-month plan is $28 a month for the first term, $40 on renewal; the annual plan is $11.66 a month for year one, $16.66 when you renew. Still, if you've, say, three devices to protect, that's around $35 a month on even the cheapest introductory deal. Kaspersky Safe Kids can't match mSpy for monitoring, but gives you more conventional parental controls features, for as many devices as you need, and costs just $15 in year one. (And that's the whole year, not per month.) MSpy's refund policy is less-than-generous, too. You can't just say, I'm unhappy, it doesn't do what I expected: the small print says you'll only get your money back if you have 'technical issues' which Support can't fix. Make sure mSpy is compatible with your devices (click the Compatibility link on the website) and has all the features you need before you sign up.  Installing mSpy is more tricky than usual, as it's not available in the app stores and you must do some extra work to set it up. (The website doesn't make it easy to find the installation steps, but there's guidance in some blog posts, like this one covering Android setup.) On an Android device, for instance, you must disable Google Play Protect. If you didn't, it would recognize mSpy as a privacy threat and not allow the installation. (If you're thinking, but isn't turning off Play Protect making the device more vulnerable to malicious apps? Then yes, that's exactly what it does. This isn't a good security idea, but it's necessary to run mSpy.) Play Protect disabled, the next step is to manually download the app file from an mSpy link, open it and follow the installation instructions. IOS installations are very different, with their own set of rules. Setup on non-jailbroken devices might only require its iCloud credentials, allowing you to install the app without having physical access to the phone. But that won't work if two factor authentication (2FA) is turned on (you have to enter a verification code on the target device.)  Once setup is complete, log into your mSpy control panel, enter your phone's details (model, phone number and so on) and you should begin to receive details about the device. Even when mSpy is installed, up and running, the phone user won't see what's happened. There's no mSpy icon on the phone, no notifications or alerts, no sign anything has changed. Even relatively technical kids are unlikely to realize they're now being monitored.  Tracking your child's activities starts on mSpy's web dashboard (a website demo uses sample data to show you how this works.) A summary page gives you a quick view of what's going on. A useful Activity graph highlights the number of WhatsApp messages, texts and other details captured over the past few days, a simple way to spot heavier-than-usual activity. You get to see which contacts are top of your child's messaging list, their most visited websites and recent locations. A left-hand dashboard gives you more details on each area mSpy monitors, if you need it: recent calls, pictures sent and received, instant messaging logs and more.  MSpy makes it easy to see what your child is doing on the web. Just tapping the Browser History tab displays the sites they've visited recently, along with the date of the last access and the total number of times they've viewed the site. A Bookmark tab displays a list of your child's current bookmarks, but this time you just get the URL, with no 'added' or 'last visited' dates. You can choose to block access to specific websites, but unlike most parental controls apps, there's no way to limit access by category type (Adult, Drugs, Violence and so on.) That's unfortunate, but it's also a consequence of mSpy's stealthy design. If an app aims to monitor a target device without the user knowing, it can't announce itself by saying 'sorry, all gambling sites are now blocked.'   It's important to understand how your kids are using their phones, so it's good to see mSpy provide a list of installed apps.  Unfortunately, there's no real detail beyond a list of app names. You can't immediately see when an app was installed, for instance, or how often it's used. Controls over app use are limited to a single Block option, where you can prevent specific apps from being launched. Standard parental control apps give you many more fine-tuned options. You might be able to limit this app to x hours use on the weekdays, for instance, and y hours at the weekends, while setting different rules for various categories of apps ('no social media after 9pm') and allowing educational apps to be used for as long as they like. MSpy is designed to run without the target realizing, though, so as with websites, it can't suddenly start telling them what they can and can't use. Simple 'installed apps' lists are the best you'll get.  MSpy logs your device position via GPS, then displays the results in its GPS Locations tab. By default, it displays these as a plain text list, with the latitude, longitude, nearest address and the location time. But the mSpy dashboard can also display locations on a map via OpenStreetMap, and you can click a link to open the location in Google Maps.  Geofencing allows you to create unlimited allowed or forbidden zones around key locations in your child's life: home, school, sports field, maybe that friend you don't want them to see. When you're set up, mSpy raises alerts as your child arrives at or leaves a specific zone.  Most of mSpy is about monitoring your child's communications with the outside world, and it generally does this very well. Choose the messaging app or communications type from the sidebar, and you'll see relevant information. There's the date, number and length of incoming and outgoing calls, for instance. MSpy logs the contact name, date and content of messaging and chat conversations. You get email logging, too, and the option to view calendar events, contact lists, new photos and videos gives you more context to what's going on.  For real in-depth monitoring, you can set up mSpy to take regular screenshots and log every keypress on the device. That tells you much more about what's going on, but it also generates more lengthy reports, and it'll take longer to work through them all. Fortunately, mSpy has a more targeted feature in its Keyword Tracking. Here, you're able to create rules which raise an alert when mSpy spots a particular word or phrase. In just a couple of minutes you can set up mSpy to look for the word 'suicide' in SMS, say, and 'porn' in instant messages, then send you an email right away: very easy. MSpy is a capable monitoring phone monitoring app which can tell you all about the messages sent to and from a device, and log many more details about how it's being used. That level of tracking may not be legal for an adult target, though, and mSpy doesn't have the screen time, internet access or device usage control to match the best parental controls apps.

        "body": "mSpy, the makers of a software-as-a-service product that claims to help more than a million paying customers spy on the mobile devices of their kids and partners, has leaked millions of sensitive records online, including passwords, call logs, text messages, contacts, notes and location data secretly collected from phones running the stealthy spyware. Less than a week ago, security researcher Nitish Shah directed KrebsOnSecurity to an open database on the Web that allowed anyone to query up-to-the-minute mSpy records for both customer transactions at mSpy’s site and for mobile phone data collected by mSpy’s software. The database required no authentication. A list of data points that can be slurped from a mobile device that is secretly running mSpy’s software. Before it was taken offline sometime in the past 12 hours, the database contained millions of records, including the username, password and private encryption key of each mSpy customer who logged in to the mSpy site or purchased an mSpy license over the past six months. The private key would allow anyone to track and view details of a mobile device running the software, Shah said. In addition, the database included the Apple iCloud username and authentication token of mobile devices running mSpy, and what appear to be references to iCloud backup files. Anyone who stumbled upon this database also would have been able to browse the Whatsapp and Facebook messages uploaded from mobile devices equipped with mSpy. Usernames, passwords, text messages and loads of other more personal details were leaked from mobile devices running mSpy. Other records exposed included the transaction details of all mSpy licenses purchased over the last six months, including customer name, email address, mailing address and amount paid. Also in the data set were mSpy user logs — including the browser and Internet address information of people visiting the mSpy Web site. Shah said when he tried to alert mSpy of his findings, the company’s support personnel ignored him. “I was chatting with their live support, until they blocked me when I asked them to get me in contact with their CTO or head of security,” Shah said. KrebsOnSecurity alerted mSpy about the exposed database on Aug. 30. This morning I received an email from mSpy’s chief security officer, who gave only his first name, “Andrew.” “We have been working hard to secure our system from any possible leaks, attacks, and private information disclosure,” Andrew wrote. “All our customers’ accounts are securely encrypted and the data is being wiped out once in a short period of time. Thanks to you we have prevented this possible breach and from what we could discover the data you are talking about could be some amount of customers’ emails and possibly some other data. However, we could only find that there were only a few points of access and activity with the data.” Some of those “points of access” were mine. In fact, because mSpy’s Web site access logs were leaked I could view evidence of my own activity on their site in real-time via the exposed database, as could Shah of his own poking around. A screen shot of the exposed database. The records shown here are non-sensitive “debug” logs.  mSpy has a history of failing to protect data about its customers and — just as critically — data secretly collected from mobile devices being spied upon by its software. In May 2015, KrebsOnSecurity broke the news that mSpy had been hacked and its customer data posted to the Dark Web. At the time, mSpy initially denied suffering a breach for more than a week, even as many of its paying customers confirmed that their information was included in the mSpy database uploaded to the Dark Web. mSpy later acknowledged a breach to the BBC, saying it had been the victim of a “predatory attack” by blackmailers, and that the company had not given in to demands for money. mSpy pledged to redouble its security efforts in the wake of the 2015 breach. But more than two weeks after news of the 2015 mSpy breach broke, the company still had not disabled links to countless screenshots on its servers that were taken from mobile devices running mSpy. Mspy users can track Android and iPhone users, snoop on apps like Snapchat and Skype, and keep a record of everything the target does with his or her phone. It’s unclear exactly where mSpy is based; the company’s Web site suggests it has offices in the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom, although the firm does not appear to list an official physical address. However, according to historic Web site registration records, the company is tied to a now-defunct firm called MTechnology LTD out of the United Kingdom. Documents obtained from Companies House, an official register of corporations in the U.K., indicate that the two founding members of the company are self-described programmers Aleksey Fedorchuk and Pavel Daletski. Those records (PDF) indicate that Daletski is a British citizen, and that Mr. Fedorchuk is from Russia. Neither men could be reached for comment. Court documents (PDF) obtained from the U.S. District Court in Jacksonville, Fla. regarding a trademark dispute involving mSpy and Daletski state that mSpy has a U.S.-based address of 800 West El Camino Real, in Mountain View, Calif. Those same court documents indicate that Daletski is a director at a firm based in the Seychelles called Bitex Group LTD. Interestingly, that lawsuit was brought by Retina-X Studios, an mSpy competitor based in Jacksonville, Fla. that makes a product called MobileSpy. The latest mSpy security lapse comes days after a hacker reportedly broke into the servers of TheTruthSpy — another mobile spyware-as-a-service company — and stole logins, audio recordings, pictures and text messages from mobile devices running the software. U.S. regulators and law enforcers have taken a dim view of companies that offer mobile spyware services like mSpy. In September 2014, U.S. authorities arrested a 31-year-old Hammad Akbar, the CEO of a Lahore-based company that makes a spyware app called StealthGenie. The FBI noted that while the company advertised StealthGenie’s use for “monitoring employees and loved ones such as children,” the primary target audience was people who thought their partners were cheating. Akbar was charged with selling and advertising wiretapping equipment. “Advertising and selling spyware technology is a criminal offense, and such conduct will be aggressively pursued by this office and our law enforcement partners,” U.S. Attorney Dana Boente said in a press release tied to Akbar’s indictment. Akbar pleaded guilty to the charges in November 2014, and according to the Justice Department he is “the first-ever person to admit criminal activity in advertising and selling spyware that invades an unwitting victim’s confidential communications.” A public relations pitch from mSpy to KrebsOnSecurity in March 2015 stated that approximately 40 percent of the company’s users are parents interested in keeping tabs on their kids. Assuming that is a true statement, it’s ironic that so many parents may now have unwittingly exposed their kids to predators, bullies and other ne’er-do-wells thanks to this latest security debacle at mSpy. As I wrote in a previous story about mSpy, I hope it’s clear that it is foolhardy to place any trust or confidence in a company whose reason for existence is secretly spying on people. Alas, the only customers who can truly “trust” a company like this are those who don’t care about the privacy and security of the device owner being spied upon. This entry was posted on Tuesday 4th of September 2018 01:22 PM Does GDPR come into play for this? Don’t they have to report it now? If they have customers in the EU AND since it contains data that GDPR defines as private – Yes, I believe that GDPR is in play here. I hope they throw the book at these people. Leaving a database full of your customer’s records wide open on the Internet is just unconscionable. It’s an act out of a playbook that I’ll never understand. And if they are based in the EU and they have assets in the EU. If not, GDPR still applies, but good luck attempting a cross-border GDPR lawsuit against a foreign entity. Thing is Readership1 – having an outstanding GDPR related law suit, or really any that are suspended in the EU makes a company far less attractive to potential investors or other companies who’d like to buy it out as they can’t expand into the EU without potentially taking a hit straight away to reputation and financially. GDPR : the answers are Yes, and Yes. The company is potentially liable for a very large fine, especially if an action is brought against them in the Czech Republic (see below). The mspy website has a Privacy Policy (www.mspy.com/privacy-policy.html) which says : “This Privacy Policy is governed by and construed with the laws of Czech Republic … Those who access the website from locations outside of the Czech Republic and European Union are responsible for compliance with local laws. Controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), other data protection laws applicable in Member states of the European Union and other provisions related to data protection is: Altercon Group s.r.o., Londýnská 730/59, Prague, 120 00, Vinohrady, Czech Republic Tel.: +420 296 245 838” The European servers are in France, so GDPR gets them there as well. The Privacy Policy includes this earnest entreaty, which I am sure the 60% of mspy users who are NOT concerned parents have all fully complied with – “You warrant … that you have informed any user(s) that are 18 years old or more that the devices used by them include mSpy software and have obtained consent from such user(s) for this kind of activity … “ London based company so the UK implementation of GDPR applies. Since they offer services to EU citizens they should be represented somewhere in EU, and that country’s implementation of GDPR applies too. mspy is not based in the UK and does not have its headquarters here. MTechnology, up until its dissolution in May 2014, supposedly had a London office but that address was only a front – a fancy address for show, but no physical presence there. If mspy are in the UK I have not been able to find them, although the assertion that they are London-based is endlessly repeated. At the time of the 2015 data leak the BBC News report said “(The) initial investigation is aimed at finding out whether the company, which has a London office, is based in the UK. The BBC has been told the company is based in California.” mspy currently has no UK office or phone number that I have been able to find. As a side-issue, the Prague-based GDPR controller (Altercon) is also registered in the UK and has an office in Edinburgh. Companies House data shows only one name, a Ukrainian from Kiev (Andrii Kurniavtsev) as a “Person with significant influence or control”. And Brian may be mistaken in saying that Fedorchuk is Russian, because the UK Companies House records for MTechnology give his nationality as “UK”, which could stand for Ukraine. Those records also show that Daletski previously had a correspondence address at 839 Howard Street, San Francisco. Great article I really think spying on your kids Snapchat is a bad idea. There are things you can’t unsee! But, children in the US don’t have any civil rights until they’re 18; ergo, no right to privacy. It’s the parents responsibility to exercise due diligence in attempting to ensure their safety. I see no reason that parents shouldn’t have administrative access to their childs online activities. In fact, I feel, they should know if little Annie is taking nude shower pix and posting it on Snapchat, Instagram, Pinterest, etc., their pix are most likely geo-tagged and leaves them exposed to sexual predators. Children, and increasingly adults, are naive to the cyber risks inherent in internet activities. I find it absolutely disconcerting that in their attempt to provide safety by trusting so-called cyber-security firms to protect them, they ultimately are helping to expose them! I was reading this and was thinking to myself, “sounds like what a Russian company would do.” And then looking at names of founders, of course they are Russian  PS. Guys, I’m curious. Wasn’t iPhone supposed to protect against this kind of behavior of apps. Namely, having access to text, or call records? PS2. Brian, it would be nice if you suggested to people how to prevent installation of such spyware on people’s phones? Any measures one needs to take so that a jealous spouse/partner didn’t install this on your phone. Thanks for the article. To do the text message thing on an iPhone you need to be the MitM unless they can forward all texts somewhere. Guess the latter is possible but I have yet to see that done. Generally speaking (unless it is malware – which this technically is not) you need physical access to the device to install the software. Generally seen them put some MDM type of software on to allow this. I’m sure there are a ton of other possibilities as mobile forensics is not my specialty but with the iPhone generally being locked down more than a Droid, it is a bit more challenging from what I have seen. Go to a Droid and I throw my hands up and all bets are off. How do you protect yourself – know who has access to or is using your phone besides yourself. Don’t click on crappy links. The software requires physical access to the device if it is not vulnerable to a remote jailbreak (i.e. the user hasn’t updated their OS in a while). So, if you don’t trust those around you or those who may be in your space, keep your phone close at hand all the time. Use a complex and unique 6-digit pin that’s needed to unlock your phone. My understanding from the last time I researched mSpy was that it utilized iCloud to provide remote monitoring ability for non-jailbroken iPhones. That is, you enter your target’s iCloud credentials into the mSpy platform and go from there. So, of course, you need to know those credentials. However, since the person spying is often a spouse or significant other, it’s not uncommon for that info to be known. With Android, it requires physical access to the device, the unlock code (if any) and you must set it to allow apps from unknown sources (pretty easy if you already have physical access). Once installed, these apps can be hidden from the user which, IMHO, is what classifies them as true spyware, rather than parental control apps (you don’t need to hide from your kids that you’re monitoring them). Many of the security apps (e.g., Lookout) will flag spyware like mSpy, but it can be hit or miss. When I looked at this a few years ago, a surprising number of spy apps slipped through the cracks (https://www.techlicious.com/review/mobile-security-apps-perform-dismally-against-spyware/). At the time, many of the security researchers at the anti-malware companies I spoke with considered these app as PUA (“potentially unwanted applications”), rather than malicious spyware. Ah, Kibana*. Its security costs extra, and it’s based around elasticsearch* which mostly doesn’t have security at all. We use it because having something to aggregate log files is handy, but, it’s a scary system. My approach is to stick it behind a web server which manages authentication and leave elasticsearch without a public IP address. But I have no faith that our system won’t be compromised. Thankfully we shouldn’t be managing PII, so I have less to worry about. *Disclaimer–I contribute to both, I feel that’s the minimum price to pay if not paying for a product. Wow! The mind boggles! I like your takeaway, Brian, and it applies to more than just phones. Thanks again, Nobby Where are we safe at the moment? The amount of fraud or mockery increases from day to day, allying itself with technology that is said to be a safety aid. Is this the type of response you’d expect from an org regulated by GDPR? My Phone ID is . I want to cancel mSpy because Installation problem – please refund my order. Software never worked. Chat started Alex Scott joined the chat Alex Scott – Hello. My name is Alex. I will assist you today. Could you please tell us what is the reason for your cancellation request? Have you encountered any technical problems while using our software or have some personal issues occurred? Maybe we can improve something? You — the software was never able to be installed. Additionally, it appears you just had a breach of my personal information. Alex Scott – Would you maybe like me to help you with installation? Could you please be more specific about that? You — please cancel service and refund prorated annual subscription amount Alex Scott – I’m afraid no valid reason for refund was stated. You — the software doesn’t work and it was never installed and that you then allowed your systems to be hacked and my personal information to be stolen is not sufficient reason for a prorated refund? Alex Scott – Please note that according to our refund policy that you read and accepted during purchase, No refund can be issued to a user in case the reasons for a refund are completely beyond mSpy control. They include […] personal reasons (I’ve changed my mind, I’ve made a purchase by mistake, Software was not used, etc.); https://www.mspy.com/refund-policy.html Unfortunately without any specifications I’m unable to open investigation about your hacked personal information. Um, you gave some pretty sad and nonspecific reasons (the ‘breach’) for asking for a refund. He tried to help you with the non-working non-installed app. So, yea, he did as expected. Also it reads like Alex is a bot – fine for FAQ-level troubleshooting but not much more. Of course. “Alex Scott” rhymes with “Bot”. They’re all failing… https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/75888/data-breach/family-orbit-hacked.html I feel bad for the kids and partners who were spied on. Conversely, I hope the radiation of 10,000 suns sear the eyeballs of those who installed this spyware on their kids and partners. “Shah said when he tried to alert mSpy of his findings, the company’s support personnel ignored him.” I’m SHOCKED! Shocked, I say… Seriously, this is a pattern of behavior that is common. Someone sees a problem and reports it but the support personnel do nothing. Why do they do nothing? Because that is their job. They are not there to fix problems. The typical support personnel contacted in a case like this are there SPECIFICALLY to dismiss people who complain but try to do so in a polite manner so no feelings are hurt. 1. Read complaint (or not–it really doesn’t matter). 2. Send boilerplate apology email and delete complaint. 3. Done. I think that parents do need to know what their dependents are doing on their devices. In my understanding, in the US the parent, not the child, is responsible for what is done with the device. However, that does not make spying OK. I advise parents to make it clear to their children that they do not legally own the device and therefore must provide admin access and be willing to let the parent see any and all information on it. That is done openly. If the child complains about privacy invasion the response is there is no privacy on an internet connected device so they are not losing anything. Its just now the parents can see what too many miscreants (to use Brian’s word) can see. A parent who doesn’t completely trust a child with a phone should just not give her one until she’s old enough to be trusted. If that means waiting to age 21, that’s fair! It’s better to deny a treat than to spy. A phone is a treat. No child needs a phone of their own. Even if you deny them a phone there are still other digital devices. I guess you could deny them all access to any device that can communicate with the internet, but that would mean no computer making it impossible to complete schoolwork.

Tomáš Paták, Spokesman, phone: +420 234 665 286, e-mail: tomas.patak@uoou.cz Mr Jiří Měsíček, International Officer, phone: + 420 234 665 235, e-mail: jiri.mesicek@uoou.cz Folks, I think we should regard two sides. Since been using the app for 4 months, I was shocked. I thought my teen would know what I was checking on her all this time. Anyway, here’s how they excuse themselves: https://blog.mspy.com/dont-panic-your-data-is-safe-blog-mspy/ A spy app that gives the physical location of the cell phone of someone in a confidential woman’s shelter puts a lot of people at risk. These secret shelters exist specifically because the women in them are escaping violent men who are likely to try to find those women and willing to kill themselves, their partners, and anyone else nearby once they find them. mSpy’s blog article about this issue amounts to a hilarious list of lame excuses and downright lies which are unlikely to convince anybody with half an ounce of sense. https://blog.mspy.com/dont-panic-your-data-is-safe-blog-mspy/ mSpy has a Wikipedia entry which was originally created by somebody who was later permanently banned for being a paid editor.

        "body": "The smartphone app market is saturated with various applications that let a person control and monitor a target phone’s mobile activity. Most of the phone tracking solutions offer the same basic capabilities and we understand that it can get frustrating trying to compare them to find the best one for your needs. The last thing anyone wants is to spend money and time on a mobile security app that does not work. However, mSpy is widely regarded as the leading spy app for tracking your phone as evidenced by its high ratings.  In the following mSpy review, we will be discussing what makes mSpy so highly rated, its benefits, and its downsides. So, read on to find out if mSpy would make a perfect choice.  mSpy is a mobile monitoring solution that can be installed on your target phone to let you monitor their mobile activities remotely. The app gives information such as phone calls, social media activity, instant messengers tracking, locations, and much more. A great thing about it is that the app runs in the background in complete incognito mode so that the target won’t know they’re being tracked.  Since its establishment in 2010, mSpy has quickly grown to be one of the most popular and well known mobile monitoring apps in the world. Not only is it reliable, easy to set up, and available for both iOS and Android cell phones, the app provides users with clear analysis into their smartphone activity.  All data collected from the app is uploaded into the company’s cloud server where you will have access to through the web-based dashboard. You can get into the dashboard from either a computer or a mobile. mSpy is a great application that offers a variety of uses. Some use it as parental control to keep tabs on their children’s mobile activity while others may install it to ensure their employees use their company smartphones for business-related matters only.  Once mSpy is installed on the mobile phone, the app will run in the background and be completely hidden to not alert the target of any such monitoring activities. Regardless of whether the app is hidden or not, there are no settings available for the app to be manipulated on the target phone.  Upon installation, the app will have almost everything on the phone or tablet, such as incoming/outgoing calls, social media conversations, instant messages, location tracking, etc. mSpy then collects all these data and sends them to your online dashboard for you to view at your convenience.  One thing to note is that the app utilizes an internet connection (either Wi-Fi or 3G/4G) to upload the information to your dashboard. This means that the target device must be connected to the internet for you to receive information. However, mSpy is not location dependent and it can work anywhere in the world as long as it has access to internet connection.  The functionality built into this highly-rated phone monitoring app is quite comprehensive. So, let’s take a quick look at each functionality to give you a better idea of what mSpy can and cannot do.   Phone Information The first thing you can see from your dashboard is plenty of information about your target information. Here are some of the basic stats that you’ll be able to see: Target Device Settings The dashboard’s control panel lets you set the default behavior for the device you want. The company understands that uploading all of this information frequently can be taxing to both your phone’s battery status and internet usage, the app lets you decide which types of information to be sent over specific connections.  For example, larger files such as videos can be set to upload once the phone is connected to Wi-Fi rather than a cellular connection. This will prevent the spy phone app from eating up a significant portion of your data plan.  Other than that, users can also set the update interval for data and location information. It is best to strike a balance where you get updated information without draining the battery too quickly. In most cases, we would suggest updating the data every 30 minutes and location information every 2 minutes.  Website Monitoring One of the most popular and widely used features offered by mSpy is website monitoring and blocking feature. Not only does this let you see which websites were visited, but it also lets you know which web pages have been bookmarked and will even send you a notification when specific keywords are typed into the browser.  This is a fantastic parental control feature for parents who want to keep a close eye on what content their kids are viewing from the internet. Since you can’t always be there to keep a watchful eye to make sure your kids aren’t getting into trouble, the mSpy control app does a great job of monitoring to free up your time for other stuff.  Additionally, the monitoring app even lets you block specific sites. However, it is somewhat browser dependent. mSpy can block websites on Chrome, Safari, or native Android browser, but it has no control over third-party browsers such as Opera.  Phone Calls and Call Blocking Another thing you can access from your control panel is all the incoming and outgoing calls from the target phone. You even get to see call times, call duration, details stored in their contacts, as well as the total number of calls. An interesting feature is that mSpy allows you to still check the phone call history after the target deletes their call log.  On top of that, mSpy even provides customers with two additional functions: Text Messages All incoming and outgoing text (SMS) messages from the target device will be tracked and monitored by mSpy as well. Information such as phone number, time, and a text message will be sent to your online dashboard for you to view anytime.  Just like the call log, the phone tracking app is still able to send the text messages to you after the owner has deleted them from their phone.  Emails Users have access to all sent and received email messages from their dashboard. From there, you get to see who is the sender/recipient, the email’s time stamp, and the content of the email itself. Similarly, you’ll still be able to see all the data from your dashboard even after the phone user deletes the emails.  Calendar & Contact Information You get access to the target phone’s contact details such as contact names, phone numbers, email addresses, etc from your dashboard. On top of that, you also get to know their calendar events and schedule. This way, you are aware of any scheduled meetings or tasks and their associated details.  GPS Location Another popular feature of the m Spy app is its GPS tracking capability. The tracking software uses the target device’s built-in GPS tracker system to instantly track phone locations accurately. Furthermore, the app even draws out the route history into a map of their location over a specified amount of time to let you see where and when they’ve been to exactly.  Geofencing On top of GPS tracking, mSpy also utilizes GPS fencing capabilities to let you set up an unlimited number of restricted zones for the target device. Once the app detects that your target phone has wandered off to a restricted zone, the app will instantly send you an email notification to let you know. mSpy will even automatically log the time and visit frequency of each zone.  Geo-Fencing is an extremely powerful feature, especially for parents as it allows them to set up a safe zone around your home, school, or other areas they normally visit. If the child leaves any one of these safe zones, parents can trust that they will be notified instantly.  Instant Messaging Apps Aside from phone calls and text messaging (SMS) spying capabilities, mSpy is even able to check messages sent through social media apps and messaging applications. This includes: Installed Applications You also get to see all of the installed applications on the target phone from your mSpy dashboard. From here, you can also choose to block or unblock specific phone apps. This functionality will help you ensure that your targets are not accessing any apps that could be harmful to them or the device/business.  Keylogging Feature Similar to Copy 9, mSpy replaces the default target keyboard to a mSpy keyboard that has the ability to track all keystrokes. You can even force mSpy to load its keyboard in the target device every time by selecting the “Force Keyboard” button in your control panel.  This is a helpful feature for monitoring certain language usage or to get login credentials, making it fantastic for those who want to hack an iPhone or Android device. However, this feature is only available for Android OS version 4 and above.  Keywords Alerts The monitoring software even notifies users whenever a certain word or phrase is used on the target phone. You get to set up any word of your choosing, like drugs, sex, porn, alcohol, etc. Simply enter all the keywords you want to be tracked and the app will instantly notify you once it detects any such words used in texts, chats, emails, etc.  Multimedia Files Users can also view all media files including photos and videos taken with the target phone from the mSpy dashboard. Not only that, but you can also see the date and timestamp for each image/video. The great part about this is that users can view the images in thumbnail or watch the videos in full.  Pros Cons Before purchasing the monitoring software, it is important to first know if your intended target device is compatible. In any case, you ought to keep in mind that the software requires you to root or jailbreak the device to get the most functionality out of it.  With that being said, here’s a list of devices and their respective requirements:  Jailbroken iOS Devices (iPad or iPhone): Non-Jailbroken iOS Devices (iPad or iPhone): Android Devices: Mac Computers: Windows-Based Computers: Although the monitoring software offers a diverse set of features, it is relatively cheaper than many other phone spy apps. mSpy comes in three packages: Basic Package, Premium Package, and Mobile Family Kit.  Basic Subscription Plan 1 month – $29.99 3 months – $59.99 6 months – $69.99 12 months – $99.99 Monitoring features include Premium Subscription Plan 1 month – $69.99 3 months – $119.99 6 months – $149.99 12 months – $199.99 Monitoring features include everything offered in Basic package plus: Family Kit This package allows you to monitor more than one device simultaneously. To find out more about their package, it is best to contact their tech support team directly via chat, email, or phone.  If you’re still on the fence about whether you should subscribe to mSpy, the company even offers customers a 7-day free trial for you to test it out before making the final decision. Their website even has a demo version to let you figure out how the cell phone tracker operates.  Here’s how to get started on monitoring and tracking a target phone remotely using the mSpy: Step 1: Purchase a subscription. Once you’ve completed the purchase process, mSpy will email you your mSpy login name and password within a few minutes.  Step 2: Open the confirmation email from your computer and click on the link provided. This will take you to your control panel dashboard. After you’ve logged in, follow the on-screen installation instructions to install mSpy software onto your target device.  Step 3: Once the software is downloaded, mSpy will start monitoring the device immediately. Simply log into your account to access all monitored data.  Before you begin the software installation process, you’ll need to first turn off Google Play Store protection. Here’s how to do it: To install the app, follow the steps below: Setting up the m Spy app: To complete the step, open your Control Panel from your computer or mobile device, fill in your target’s info, and choose the target OS. The app will then send you a Registration Code which you’ll need to key in to activate mSpy. After you press the Finish button, go to mSpy and use your username and password to login your account. You can now start monitoring your device remotely! The mSpy app installation (no jailbreak) is much easier on an iOS device compared to an Android phone. This is mainly because you don’t have to install mSpy manually onto your target device. Instead, you only need to know the target device’s iCloud credentials or Apple ID. Here are a few steps to get you started: Before jailbreaking your phone, you need to first check whether your device can be jailbroken or not as many newer models do not have the jailbreak option available yet.  To check your iOS version, you can go to Settings > General > About > Version Once you’ve successfully jailbroken the Apple device, you can now go to your control panel and choose iPhone to continue the installation guide. The entire jailbreaking procedure and installing the monitoring software programs may take about 30 minutes or so.  However, the jailbreaking process may be complicated for some. So, if you’re not tech-savvy or comfortable handling the installation, you can always pay a small fee for mSpy to handle the entire process for you.  Another great thing about mSpy is its superior customer support. As a paying customer, you can contact their 24 hours email support or 24/7 live chat support staff. Their friendly technical support team will be able to help guide you through any issues that come up during the installation or use of the product.  From our tests, we were able to receive an email reply from customer service in less than 30 minutes while chat times are significantly less (obviously!). We never had to wait more than 2 minutes to have a mSpy support representative respond to our chat requests.  After going through numerous reviews on mspy, we think you know that mSpy monitoring app is considerably one of the best and most reliable spy apps many can count on. Whether you’re a concerned parent, an employer, or someone who just wants to make sure that their target devices are being used appropriately and safely, the mSpy app will definitely get the work done for you. mSpy offers decent premium features such as the ability to read sent and received text messages, view call logs, check web browser history, and more to help you monitor the phone. All these data are then uploaded into the company’s server where you’re able to monitor and check from the user-friendly mSpy dashboard.  Another great thing about mSpy is that they come in three different packages at affordable pricing options to suit your requirements. There are also significant cost savings for paying either quarterly or annually.  Hopefully, this review of mSpy has provided you with better insights and ideas on how this monitoring software works.  Q: Is mSpy safe? Yes, mSpy is completely safe. While different versions of the software may require different methods of installation, they will have no impact on the cell phone and can be completely removed once it’s no longer required.  Q: Which smart phones, tablets, and computers are compatible with mSpy? mSpy is compatible with a variety of devices. For jailbreak versions, all iPhones from iOS 6 – 8.4 and 9 – iOS 9.1 are supported. Whereas all iOS versions are supported for the non-jailbreak version.  mSpy supports all android phones with the operating system of Android 4.0 and above.  For windows, the supported OS includes Windows XP x32, Windows Vista x32, x64, Windows 7 x32, x64, Windows 8, 8.1, and Windows 10. For mac computers, the supported OS includes Mac OS 10.7 Lion, Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, OS X 10.9 Mavericks, OS X 10.10 Yosemite, and OS X 10.11 El Capitan. Q: Will mSpy work anywhere? Yes, as mentioned in the mSpy review above, the spy app will work anywhere in the world as long as the target device is internet-able. The software will send all the data from the device back to your control panel automatically.  Q: Is using mSpy legal? Yes, using mSpy is legal if you’re the owner of the phone. For employers who want to monitor a company phone, you’ll need to notify the employee that the device is being monitored. However, it is completely up to you whether you plan to tell your child if you’re monitoring their phone as a parental control measure. One grey area is installing mSpy to keep an eye on your spouse or partner as telling them would obviously reduce the chances of catching them in the act.  Q: Is mSpy detectable? No, mSpy is not detectable. It will not appear on the app drawer list or even in the app manager. Depending on how frequently you set the app to upload info, the app also does not drain the battery in a way that could lead to suspicions.  Q: Can mSpy monitor multiple devices? Yes, mSpy can monitor multiple devices with the Family Plan. All the devices being monitored simultaneously will be shown on your dashboard where you can quickly change from one to the next. This is great if you need to track a number of workers or multiple children at the same time.  Q: Will jailbreaking an iPhone void the device warranty? No, jailbreaking will not void the device warranty since you can update the iOS or simply reset the phone to factory default to reverse the jailbreak.  Q: do I remove mSpy? To uninstall mSpy on iOS devices, simply open the app and click uninstall. Go to iPhoneInternalService, click Modify, and click on the Remove option. For android devices, go to Phone Settings > Security > Device Administrators > Update Service and click Deactivate. Then go back to Settings > Apps > Update Service and click on uninstall.    As a Master Degree graduate in the Internet Technology field, Stefan is highly dedicated towards improving the overall web security so internet users can browse freely without having to be afraid of technical loopholes.

        "body": "Internet Security Reviews  Some parental control solutions put up barriers to prevent your kids from seeing inappropriate content, while others let you monitor exactly what your children are doing at all times. UK-based mSpy is firmly in the latter category, and the clue is very much in the name. Since 2010, the service has given parents some startlingly thorough monitoring capabilities, allowing parents to see interactions from a large number of social media networks including Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. mSpy is also able to track a phone’s GPS to see your child’s exact location, lets you set up select areas where your children are allowed to go, and notifies you if they stray from that location. Although the software isn’t the cheapest on the market, it does offer a free demo for users to test out first. Installing mSpy isn’t the easiest thing to do, as it requires you to jailbreak iOS devices or have Android phones rooted to access all features. You also need to have your child’s device at hand to install the app since it isn’t available on Google Play or the Apple App Store. Instead, you’ll have to download it directly from the mSpy website so make sure your child’s phone allows you to download apps from outside sources. Once you’ve finished the process, the software advises you to delete mSpy from your browser history. But you need to be careful when installing the software: if you don’t do everything correctly (like not changing certain settings on your phone) then mSpy won’t work to its full capacity and you’ll have to repeat the entire process again.         Now, you’ll be able to start monitoring and data takes only a matter of minutes to appear. The mSpy dashboard functions well with everything in a logical place. From the main menu you can access the call logs, which show you the caller’s ID, whether the call was incoming or outgoing, the call duration (or if it was missed), and even the exact date and time of calls made before mSpy was installed. It’s a similar case for text messages, as you’ll be able to read full SMS messages that were already on the device. mSpy also lets you see a phone’s photos, videos, and view the calendar’s upcoming events. The GPS tracking is impressive – pinpointing our exact location perfectly – and the handy geofencing tool is easy to set up, so you’ll know if your child goes out of bounds. mSpy’s internet monitoring shows parents when a website was accessed, and how often a child visited it. Parents also have the ability to block specific websites, but mSpy would benefit from the inclusion of a content filter to prevent children from accessing certain types of websites that are inappropriate.       Of course, the main selling point of mSpy is that it lets you read messages sent over Snapchat, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, and a whole host of other services. This will require a jailbroken or rooted phone, but it’s an incredible amount of data that lets you know exactly what your children are up to or if they’re victims of cyberbullying. But one major concern we have about mSpy is that it has suffered two serious data breaches in 2015 and 2018 that have included passwords, call logs, and location data being leaked. While mSpy’s response to this wasn’t too reassuring (there were no statements at all from the company about the 2018 incident), the company ensures that all customer account details and personal data are securely encrypted. Now we get to the elephant in the room: mSpy is well known for its spyware capabilities. Indeed, years ago the software was marketed as a way of helping suspicious people catch their cheating spouses – the company even sold phones with mSpy pre-installed. Certainly, if someone wanted to do that they easily could. Of course, this is strictly illegal as mSpy reminds its users. Now the company exclusively refers to itself as parental control software and should only be used as such. The main feature of mSpy is that is shows you messages from a variety of different social media apps. WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, Skype, and other social media apps are covered – including dating apps like Tinder. Even self-destructing messages on Telegram and vanishing images on Snapchat aren’t able to hide from mSpy as the software takes frequent screenshots when those apps are open. If you don’t want your child using a particular social media app, then you have the option of blocking the app remotely. One major drawback of mSpy is that Android phones need to be rooted and iOS devices need to be jailbroken for the software to work to its full potential. Doing this is a tricky process, but you can get live assistance from mSpy’s customer service to help you do it – providing you sign up to the extra mAssistance customer support service. It should be noted that this will likely mean voiding the warranty on your child’s phone. If, understandably, you don’t want to jailbreak your phone then your monitoring powers are reduced. But mSpy does its best to offer as many features as possible for those users. Due to the nature of its services, mSpy isn’t the cheapest parental control option. Prices vary depending on how long you want to keep the software for, with discounts for longer subscriptions. Indeed, a monthly subscription is quite expensive at $48.99, but by paying an annual fee instead you can pay the equivalent of just $11.66 per month. If a year is too long a subscription for you can also get a 3-month plan, which works out at $27.99 per month. All accounts only cover one device, but there is a family plan that covers up to three devices with prices available by contacting mSpy’s customer support team directly. mSpy offers a loyalty plan to its customers, which gives you 15% off your subscription fee for your next renewal. You may also be lucky enough to catch one of the website’s deals – usually offering a discount of 40%. However, before you reach for your wallet you can test out mSpy through the free demo version. Payment is accepted from all major credit cards and by wire transfer. All purchases come with a 14-day money-back guarantee, but it’s worth reading mSpy’s refund policy first to make sure you won’t be excluded from it. mSpy has different levels of support and you will have to pay extra for certain services. If you don’t want to pay, then you can still get support through mSpy’s live chat or by submitting a request through the online form. If you need support quickly you can upgrade to the Support Priority Line for $12.99, which gives you priority response and 24/7 service. Also, if you’re having issues with installing mSpy, for $53.99 you get round-the-clock installation assistance, including helping you root or jailbreak your phone. Although you can find mSpy on social media it’s not the ideal way to get help.         The mSpy website hosts a help center, with guides to setting up the software on Android or iOS devices, as well as tackling any issues you may encounter with the software. There’s also a regularly-updated blog with advice for parents of things they should look out for when it comes to their kids’ online safety. There aren’t many parental control tools on the market that are able to monitor as thoroughly as mSpy. Parents can see exactly what their children are doing and who they’re talking to thanks to the software’s extensive social media monitoring. It’s not perfect though, we still have some concerns about mSpy’s safety after having customer’s data leaked in the past. There’s also the matter of price, as the software is one of the most expensive on the market. However, you certainly get a lot of bang for your buck. If you’re not sure whether it’s worth investing your money, we recommend testing out the free demo to see exactly how mSpy can help you keep your kids safe online.

I was going through terrible times with my partner. I suspected he was cheating and I needed proof of this to back my claims. I couldn’t continue with this. All I wanted was to be sure of what was going on before I make any decision. I don’t make blind conclusions; I always want to see the proof for myself. I took the pain of searching for a professional IT expert who can help me spy and track all communication applications on his phone ( WhatsApp,Text messages, call logs and email). I was able to meet an amazing hacker named Webhubghost (@) gmaiilcom his hack services was professionally executed. All the hack was done remotely. He didn’t need physical access to the phone before it was hacked. Under 6 hours, the hack was done. Between these 6 hours, I was given updates about the progress of the hack work. This gave me rest of mind; it was very easy to trust his work. You can reach out to him at Webhubghost (@) gmaiilcom If you are interested in any of his services which ranges from phone hacking to social media account hacking, he will definitely deliver a perfect and swift service for you. I recommend Ben as the best option now because he is fast and reliable. I promised him to share his reputation across all online platforms for getting this done for me at last cause his services are untraceable and efficient not like those fakers I met previously.

If for no other reason than the GPS location can turn out very efficient if you are losing your phone or if someone steals it. There is no need to panic every time you can’t find your phone because one simple click on the mSpy control panel will tell you the location of your device. Even if you might have guessed some of the features that mSpy has to offer, we should address each one of them for a much better understanding. Knowing what each feature can do for you, will help you make the most out of this monitoring software! The following features will be available on most cell phones and if one of them is not available for you, there is great tech support to help you! GPS tracking GPS tracking is one of the most important features of mSpy and the reason why many people choose this app over others. GPS location comes in more versions. You can use it to check the past location of the user and current location on a map. The current location will show you where the device is in real-time. This feature can be very efficient if you track your child or if you lost your own device. You can access the GPS map right from your control panel by simply signing into your mSpy account. Track all the text messages you want You might think that most spy apps allow you to track text messages such as SMS ones or MMS ones. But mSpy takes this feature a level higher. Not only that you can track the incoming and outgoing text messages but you can also read the ones that the user deleted. We know that text messages with sensitive information might get deleted fast especially to not allow any tracking activities. But if you use mSpy, you can see all types of messages with no problem. You will also know when or if a certain text message was erased from the target device. Stay aware of all the call history Since you will use mSpy on a target phone, tracking call logs is one of the musty have features you might be looking for in this software. It is important to know who is calling your child or spouse as well as the calls they initiate. Most often than not, important information is exchanged through phone calls rather than text as it doesn’t leave any trace like that. This is why it is important to notice if there is a certain number that pups up more often than others. You can check the hours at which the conversations took place as well as the complete duration of each phone call. Check out all the chats We established that you can check out text messages both incoming and outgoing ones but what about other types of chats. With so many social media apps available nowadays, your child might use other platforms to keep in touch with people. This spy software gives you access to any type of chat on the target phone. You can track Facebook Messenger, Snapchat, Instagram DMs, Whatsapp, Kik, or any other online chat app. To access complete conversations, all you have to do is log into the mSpy account and see each chat on your control panel. The keylogger feature If you install mSpy on an Android cell phone you get access to the keylogger feature. This is a bonus feature that is only available on Android phones. To enjoy the keylogger, the Android version has to be a minimum 4.0 one. By using this feature you see everything the user types on the target device. MSpy records all the keystrokes on the phone so you will be aware of sensitive information such as passwords, emails, or any other important information the user types. Access to all emails For those who want to track their coworkers, employees but even if you track your family members, checking their emails can be a very efficient feature. You will see the incoming and outgoing emails from the target device and by doing so, you can be aware of more aspects of the user’s life. This feature is available for all email platforms including the famous Gmail, Hotmail or Yahoo. You have the key to any email you are interested in reading right in the control panel of your mSpy account. See all media files Sometimes a picture can make more than a thousand words. With mSpy you can track all the photos, videos or audio files on the target cell phone. You can even see the ones that the user deleted and you can save them into your control panel. This is a feature that can give you a proof of cheating or dishonest behavior in a blink of an eye and with no additional effort. And it is available on all versions of mSpy app. Browsing history Checking the browsing history of a user can tell you a lot of things about that person. You will find out some of their interests and also how they spend the majority of their time. MSpy helps you check the browsing history on a target phone. You will see what previous websites the user visited as well as how much time they spent on each website. And this feature will work just as well on each browser they might be using. Contact list and calendar Having access to the contacts on the target phone is very efficient. You can check out the contacts your child ore spouse saved on their phone and easily notice which ones they use more frequently. At the same time, mSpy gives you the possibility to check any planner application they might be using. You will see their schedule as well as the to-do lists and other notes they might be saving on their device. If you use mSpy to track your child, checking their schedule can help you correct any time they might waste with activities that are not in their benefit. Keywords notifications They keywords notification feature is very useful for busy parents that still want to stay on top of any online risks when it comes to their children. It is a very easy to use feature. All you have to do is set up some keywords and the mSpy app will notify you every time those words appear in a chat conversation, a text or an online search. This will save you from plenty of hours of reading through chats and archives. You will have to set up the keywords in a wise way. For instance, make a list that would be representative of cyberbullying chats or online threats. You can also use words like “drugs”, “weapons” or “sex” and you will receive an alert every time your child comes across one of these keywords. Control the apps and websites you allow on the phone A very original feature of mSpy that you might not find in many other similar apps is the fact that you can block any app or website you want on the target phone. First, you will have to check the apps that are already installed on the target device and you can decide which one of these apps might not be appropriate for your child. Once you identified the app you can use the control panel of your mSpy account to block it. From the moment you block it, the user will not be able to access that app. The same technique goes for websites of all kinds. Block calls and texts Similarly, with blocking the apps or websites, mSpy allows you to block any call log or texts from certain accounts as well. If you consider that there are hazardous contacts on the phone’s memory, all you have to do is block them. This will stop any incoming or outgoing interaction between the target phone and a particular contact. If you use mSpy to track your child this could turn out to be a very safe and useful feature! It is completely invisible The most important aspect about spy apps of all kinds is their discretion level. You might not want the person you are tracking to know that you are using such a spy software on their phone. And to be completely covered, mSpy can become invisible once you install it. The icon will disappear from the phone’s screen as well and this app has such a small size that no one will notice its presence in any device. You will be glad to find out that mSpy is compatible with almost any type of device that uses an Android or iOS system. The versions of the app might defer as well as some features of it but you can use it nevertheless. Jailbroken iOS devices You can install mSpy on iOS devices that are jailbroken or that are not jailbroken. In the case of jailbroken iPhone or iPad you will need an operating system with an iOS version between 6 – 8.4; 9 – 9.1. Either one of these iOS versions will work just as well so you don't need to update them unless you have to do that. You should also make sure that the target device is connected to the internet via Wi-Fi or mobile data. Keep in mind that you should have physical access to the device in order to install this spy app successfully. iOS devices for mSpy without jailbreak If you use an iOS device without jailbreak, you should also have access to the phone in order to download and install mSpy. You will also need the iCloud credentials if your iPhone or iPad is not jailbroken. The iCloud credentials are the ID and password of your Apple account. Furthermore, you will have to deactivate the two steps authentication for your particular Apple ID and also turn on the iCloud backup feature from the settings of the device. The target iPhone or iPad should also have Wi-Fi networks connection during the installation. Android devices You can use mSpy on Android devices as well. This spy app will be compatible with any Android system of 4.0 or higher. You should check the internet connection before trying to use mSpy on any Android device, being it a phone or a tablet. However, this app is not offering the same features for rooted and unrooted devices. Tracking apps like Facebook Messenger, Skype, Snapchat, Viber, WhatsApp or Gmail will require you to use a rooted device. Also, other instant messages platforms might need a rooted phone to function properly. Just like with iOS devices, you will need to have physical access to the device you install mSpy on. Windows devices MSpy used to be available for several versions of Windows and you could install it on any laptop with one of these operating system. However, nowadays, the manufacturer stopped the Windows version of this app, therefore you might not be able to use it on a computer. MAC devices Similarly with the Windows version, the MAC version of mSpy is no longer available on the market. But considering that this spy app is compatible with Android and iOS devices you might not feel the need to add it to a MAC device as well. As you most likely expected, mSpy comes at different prices according to the plan you choose as well as the version of this app that you prefer. There are three versions of mSpy: Basic, Premium and No Jailbreak. The Basic version comes at a cost of $29.99 per month and $99.99 per year. At the same time, if you choose the Premium version, you will have to pay around $69.99 for one month and $199.99 for 12 months. Ultimately, the No Jailbreak version of mSpy comes with the same price as the Premium version. Considering the important features of mSpy, you will find the price of this app rather budget-friendly. Plus, if you choose the annually subscription you will enjoy a significant discount so this app will be that much more worth it. Installing mSpy is very easy, regardless of the type of target device you use or its operating system. Here are the main steps that you will have to go through in order to start using mSpy! 1. First of all, you will need to get a hold of the target phone you want to use in order to download and install mSpy. This might be easier or harder depending on who the user of this target device is. If you are trying to track your child’s or partner’s phone it might be easier to get a hold of it than if you want to track your coworker’s phone. You will only need to get access to the actual phone when you install mSpy because after this stage, you will be able to control the app remotely by simply using your mSpy login information. 2. Purchase the mSpy version and plan that you are interested in using. You can do that by accessing the mSpy website. You will find there all the plans available as well as all the versions so you can get the one that will be compatible with the operating system or your target phone. When you completed the purchase, you will receive an email with your log in information so you can access your account. This first email you receive from mSpy will also come with all the instructions you need to use the app without any problems. 3. You should confirm the email you receive from your computer or phone. Once you hit the confirmation link, you will get to the control panel of your mSpy account. Here you will find further instructions on how to install this tracking app on the target device of your choice so follow them carefully. 4. The next step will be to download the version of mSpy you want on the target device. This shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. You also have to grant the access mSpy asks during download such as access to photos, contacts or other apps on the phone. 5. When the download phase is done, all you have left to do is install the spy app on the target device. This will also be a rapid step with just a few minutes of time invested in it. After the installation, you can set up the keywords list if you need to use this m Spy feature. When all the settings are complete your mSpy app will start running in the invisible mode on the background of your target phone. The user of the phone you track will not notice that there is mSpy app running on their device. 6. When you decide that you no longer need to use mSpy, you can simply uninstall it remotely from your control panel. You can also change certain settings from your mSpy account. So, you will not have to get a hold of the target device at all once you downloaded and installed the mSpy app on it.  No, unfortunately, mSpy is not the type of spy app that can be installed remotely on any target device. As a matter of fact, this is not possible for any type of app. There are some programs that can be installed by sending a random file to the target phone. Once the user opens the file, the installation of a spy app begins. But this is not the case with mSpy. Keep in mind though that you can always uninstall and control mSpy remotely which is a significant advantage. It is normal to be skeptical when it comes to a spy app that you want to try out. After all there are so many options to choose from on the market that you might be confused in finding just the one you need. But the truth is that mSpy is the type of monitoring app that you can definitely rely on. It will offer you impeccable results regardless to whom you want to monitor with this software. The first thing that you should do when you question the efficiency of a spy app is to check the previous reviews. The fact that mSpy will become invisible as soon as you install it on your target device is a very useful aspect. Plus, the features of this app make it a very efficient investment that will change your life as soon as you start using it. So, mSpy is definitely the type of spy app that you can not only rely on but also use with the entire trust. Using mSpy is just as easy as installing it. As soon as you get this app going all you have to do is access the control panel. You will use the log in information you established when you set up your mSpy account. Keep in mind that you can use this app from any other device including your personal phone, laptop or tablet. As soon as you open your control panel, you have access to all the data you might be interested in checking out. You will be able to select the type of information you want to uncover. You can choose to check different conversations from a variety of chatting platforms such as Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, Snapchat, Viper, and even Instagram direct messages. You can save these chats in your phone or laptop by downloading copies of these conversations. Similarly, you can check out other sections of your control panel such as browsing history, social media accounts, text messages, call logs and GPS location. Each section is easy to find and access with a simpler click. You can use the control panel to access any media file you want as well, including pictures, audio files and videos. Every time you access any type of information you want, the user of the target device will have no idea. This app is completely discreet and entirely safe so you have nothing to worry about. If by any chance you run into certain issues with your control panel, you can get in touch with the customer support. This spy app has great customer support that you can access via email or phone. You can get in contact with the customer support team at any hour and in any day as they have a 24/7 schedule. But chances are that you will not need there help very often as mSpy tends to be the type of spy app that works smoothly. MSpy will start working almost as soon as you finish installing it. The moment your installation is complete, mSpy will start to run in the invisible mode on the background of the target device. The user of the phone you want to track will not notice the presence of mSpy as it will not take much space in the device’s memory not it will require for any updated approval. You can get access to the data you want immediately by simply using your control panel. So, it just takes minutes from the moment you download and install mSpy on a device until you can get the data you want on your account. However, it is important to have realistic expectations at the sa\\me time. This means that you should be aware of the fact that mSpy will track the activities on the target device from the moment you install this app on it. It will not track previous messages, files or any other information. You can consider the installation moment the time when your adventure with mSpy starts. One of the most common concerns for people who decide to use mSpy is how legal this app actually is. It is essential to understand that the legal aspect of this app depends on the way you use it. If you use it to track your child’s phone activity, you should know that you have nothing to worry about, especially if your kid is underage. In such a situation, the phone your child uses is most likely on your name which makes using mSpy completely legal since you will install this tracking software on your own property. At the same time, if you use mSpy to track your employees, most likely you will track work phones with this app. Work phones are also your property which eliminates any legal concern as well. So, using mSpy on any type of device that you legally own, shouldn’t give any worries. However, if you want to use mSpy on a phone that is not your property, you can simply tell the person that owns the phone what are your intentions. This can be tricky because many times, the legal owner of a device is not also the user of that device. Thanks to this aspect it might be easier than you expected to get in the legal path of this. You can also take the risk of simply installing mSpy on a device you want to track and count on the fact that this app is completely undetectable. Being invisible as mSpy runs in the background of the device, no one will ever be aware of the fact that you used this spy app.  If you are interested in monitoring also deleted messages, mSpy will help you do that as well. Since you will get the messages in real time, you will also be aware of the moment they got deleted at. You can check all the messages, from the control panel of this software. This feature applies to text messages as well as online chats and other social media interactions. And truth being told, deleted messages might be the most interesting ones so you don't want to miss them out! This app is extremely discreet, which is also one of its best qualities. You will not have to worry about any notifications or updates showing up on the target device. Once you install this software, it will run in stealth mode so that the user will never be aware of it. The only person who will be able to see the data stored on this app as well as control it will be you, as long as you log into your control panel. No, unless you tell them. MSpy encourages open communication between parents and their children. So, the best way is to tell your child about the presence of mSpy on the device that they use. But if you don’t feel comfortable to tell them about this app, you can count on the fact that mSpy is undetectable. The icon of this app gets hidden automatically after the installation process is complete. You have the option to choose if you want to keep the icon visible as well. But unless you choose this option, mSpy will become completely invisible. In order to get the best version of mSpy you should check the official website of this app. You can find it on Google play as well as the iOS store but it is a lot easier to download it from the official source. Once you got the app and paid the subscription of your choice you will receive all the instructions you needed to install mSpy properly. You will also get a download link that you can use for the target device of your choice. No, everyone can use mSpy as it is easy and relatively accessible.

So it’s been a few years, but basically this still works!   Hi and thank you for dropping by my Mspy Sign In website, you can read the Full Mspy Review Below… I hope my info on this Mspy Sign In site will help out in some way with your search for the right cell phone spy software.     If you’ve read my ‘about me’ section on this site you will notice that I run my own business with delivery drivers. How My Worries Started – I couldn’t always work out where my drivers where or what they were up to. They could even be in a bar having a drink for all I knew. Maybe you have a different problem, like needing to know where your children are and what they are doing.. Basically all these problems have the one solution – cell phone spying software.   So that’s when my search began – First of all I searched for a free cell Spy Software that I could download. I thought I’d found one but unfortunately it was packed with viruses and didn’t work properly. The worst part of it was that the software only worked intermittantly and the data wasn’t accurate. You obviously can’t question anyone about what you have discovered if the information isn’t right. So my warning is don’t download spy software FREE as it probably won’t work and you may open yourself up to unwanted viruses and other computer problems. The conclusion – don’t waste time, get one that works. “Mspy Is An Excellent Phone Monitoring Software, It Has Helped Me Keep A Constant Track Of Employees. Running my Business Would Now Be Tough For Me Without Mspy.” “If you like this page, could you quickly help us out by sharing this page? You can like, share, or tweet this page below: – THANKS!”    The main reason I decided to start this review website Mspy Sign In began when I needed to know what my employees were doing and where they where. My Motivation to begin this site was before I found Mspy I searched for some guidance about which spy software would suit my needs and I had a tough job to find the right info. To discover more about cell spying software in general check out this article. I Failed To Find An App That Worked! – I lost over $270 on different phone spy and monitoring software. As you probably have found out there is nowhere you can get free software that actually works. You really cannot download the genuine Mspy free anywhere. Due to me being particular about checking product details before buying and after searching online I was amazed to find nothing of any real use to me about which software I needed. I tried some software that only had half the features I expected , eg the GPS locator was way out. In the end I almost gave up trying until I finally stumbled across Mspy mentioned in an online group I belong too. “At Last”! – Once I downloaded Mspy I was amazed at how easy it was to setup, and all the features worked perfectly. I could track location, text messages, calls, instant messages, browsing etc – in fact more than I needed for my purpose. If anyone in is need of a good spy software, I do hope this website helps as I am sure there are many people about who are just like me.     Let me explain exactly what Mspy is. Mspy is a cell phone monitoring/tracking system that once installed allows you to listen in on phone calls, view text messages, find out location, as well as having many more features. This type of software has many uses depending on your exact situation, in my position it was the need tracking where my employees were. Another use that’s becoming more common is parents checking where their child is and what they are doing. Please continue reading the Mspy Sign In review site as I will be going over more of the benefits I found from using this software next. To sum up Mspy Gives You Full Access To The Truth About Your Workers or Children.      Once you have signed up and installed the Mspy App, it will record all the phone’s data and store it in your Mspy online account. You can access this at any time after you sign in from your PC or phone. This allow you to monitor everything including text messages, , photos, videos, browser history emails, locations, call details, instant messages and record the phone’s surrounding. Mspy works invisibly so the phone’s user will know nothing about it. The benefits Mspy brings will obviously depends on your own circumstances, and you must check the legal position before using it.   If you’d like to check up on your workers (remember to check the legal aspect first!) then Mspy Sign In allows you to see their location, monitor calls, text messages etc, and even listen in on the surroundings – so you can check if they ifthey are somewhere they shouldn’t be. This is a very powerful cell phone spying software but you must think about how you use it.   If you want to keep your child safe you can use it to tell you their location using GPS, you can also view their instant messages, text messages, emails, facebook and twitter, if you want to.   Whatever use you put this to you will need access to the phone for a short time to install an app – this is true whatever brand of this type of software you use.      After a careful look at the Mspy website I found a couple of features I didn’t like:      What I Loved About Mspy Sign In Mspy has many great features, below is my list of the ones I liked most        Welcome back to the Mspy Sign In website!

Knowing exactly where all my staff where and also what they were up to helped avoid problems happening The Mspy App did all that it claimed on their site and gave me all the info I need.

Kiedy rozmawiałem o tej kwestii z dyrektorami oprogramowania kontroli rodzicielskiej mSpy, byli oni bardzo klarowni co do tego, jaki rodzaj nadzoru jest w porządku, a jaki nie. Informowanie dziecka, że jest ono monitorowane dla własnego bezpieczeństwa i że przestanie, gdy nauczy się dobrze korzystać z Internetu, jest jak najbardziej słuszne.

Za sprawą szczegółowego monitorowania połączeń dowiesz się do kogo dzwonią Twoje pociechy oraz kto dzwoni do nich. Natomiast dzięki monitorowaniu mediów społecznościowych w tym aplikacji takich jak Facebook Messenger, Instagram i Snapchat dowiesz się co i do kogo pisze Twoje dziecko.

        "link": "https://mobiespy.com/blog/mspy-review/",
        "desc": "mSpy is the most used and popular cell phone spy software, however, popularity does not always measure its reliability. You see, people create fake reviews, post comments and all of a sudden a particular product is 'popular', but its authenticity lies in the actual working.",
        "body": "  Visit the mSpy website now There are plenty of reviews found online, but they often mislead the users since everybody claims that it is good, but one can only find this out after using the product. Therefore a genuine review requires testing, and a great deal of a testing!  I created this genuine mSpy review for those that need some help looking at the various features before deciding on a purchase. I tested this software on both an iPhone and my Samsung running Android. Let’s get to the review: mSpy is a full featured spy app and works perfectly on cell phones and tablets – both are important devices which the majority of people use. Therefore it becomes a crucial point to keep it in mind that the Operating system of the targeted gadget must be compatible with the spy software. The app currently supports iOS and Android platforms for mobile devices, but also offers the service for PC Windows and MAC OS computers. Latest compatible versions; Though the software is flexible, and operates perfectly with these devices and operating systems, you should check for any update regarding the version support for your particular device. In fact, I would advise that you check your particular device and model for compatibility with the software. This can be done by visiting the mSpy website and reviewing features and then visiting the compatibility checker: Without a flaw mSpy covers all of the basic monitoring needs such as sms, email call logs, real time GPS location and web browser history. You can now also view deleted mail, mail that has been read and even unread messages on the target phone. These messages are uploaded to the mSpy control panel and will be available for you to view! In addition to this it has many advanced features which makes it a real stand out from the pack. Monitor IM Services – mSpy is excellent in monitoring the various instant messenger applications such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Viber, Skype and iMessage for iPhone. These features work for only rooted Android and iPhone devices that have a jailbreak. Call Blocking – Now this is another feature you might be looking forward to using, and with mSpy you get to use it without downloading any other application. You can define and block all the numbers you want to. Website Blocking – Similar to call blocking facility, you can preset websites you want to block. Application Blocking – You can easily see all the applications installed in the cell phone you are monitoring, and you can block the apps as well. This turns out as a great tool to monitor your kid’s cell phone! Keylogging – mSpy gives you another advanced feature which is unique; Keylogging! This feature tracks everything on the target cell phone including login details, emails, messages. Security Feature – mSpy gives you enough control on the cell phone that you can effectively lock the phone, wipe the data, get notified if the sim gets changed or removed, and similarly block or delete any apps of the phone which you think are unnecessary. You can control the phone through the control panel. Apart from the features of the software, here are a couple of things we like and think are worth mentioning! Easy Navigation – The first thing which helps customers is how good a website is! Not only is the website easy to navigate, but everything is clearly and completely presented. Demo Website – Apart from easy website, they also have a demo page which effectively gives you an idea of how the software tracks everything. This demo page has all the elements which your actual dashboard will have, so before purchasing the software you can check out the demo page. Money Back Guarantee – It’s always recommended to read out the terms and conditions before purchasing anything. But in case you’re not satisfied with the working of software you can get your money refunded within 10 days of your purchase. Tech Support – mSpy takes customer service very seriously! They do have live chat, an email option and a hotline where you can report any issues you face. In fact this is a must have service, because there are many other spy software programs which are being sold like hot cakes but have no real tech support. Varied Pricing – mSpy offers its monitoring plans in 2 versions, i.e mSpy Basic and mSpy Premium. But even for these plans you can have service for the duration you want. For example there are 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, and 1 year plans. The basic versions gives you all the simple monitoring tools, whereas all the exclusive one’s such as WhatsApp tracking etc comes in the Premium one. mSpy runs on jailbroken/non-jailbroken iOS devices. In the former case, you need physical access for installation. In the latter case, you need no access if you have iCloud credentials, but you get fewer monitoring features. Still, the access may become necessary if iCloud backup isn’t activated on the device.​ In addition for Android users, some mSpy features require rooting. For detailed features of mSpy you should visit their website here  Basic Package: Offers most basic features, with the exception of more advanced functions.1 Month: $29.99 – 3 Months: $59.99 – 1 Year: $99.99 Premium Package: Offers all features & functions.1 Month: $69.99 – 3 Months: $119.99 – 1 Year: $199.99 Computer Package: Apple OS, or Windows computer desktops, laptops.1 Month: $29.99 – 3 Months: $39.99– 1 Year: $69.99 mSpy offers straight-forward and affordable plans that provide great value for the functionality they provide. We can confidently recommend mSpy to all groups and levels of users looking for tracking application services. The various packages are offered to help better suit your needs. Users may change their targeted device as much as wanted. Bundle packages are also available if you want to monitor both cell phones and computers together.​ As we discussed earlier, a software’s fame doesn’t guarantee its reliability. But there are key points worth noticing while you check for anything’s, particularly a software’s authenticity. mSpy is sold by a UK based company, MTechnology Ltd. and they have offices in United States Of America and United Kingdom. Their Contact Page has full information about how they can be reached out. They have secure payment modes, mainly PayPal, Master Card, Visa, and American Express. The software has been around for more than four years, and in this short span of time they’ve become leaders of this genre. If a product is right for you or not depends on what your needs are! The features you need is something you need to decide on in advance and then find out the options you get with a particular package. For example, many will be contented with the basic monitoring features, and you can then compare all those softwares which provide you the basic monitoring features with respect to the prices. You can visit the mSpy website here But for those who want a bit more you can check out Mobistealth or FlexiSPY; though both are almost similar, still they boast some exclusive features such as call recording and surround recording. mSpy’s premium features and word class reliability make it a number one choice and should be great for your needs if you do not need the recording features. To wrap up mSpy hands on review, I would suggest this service to all parents, and small company employers looking for a dependable service, competitive price, and secure handling of your personal data. Additionally, they are the most feature rich and well rounded service across Apple iOS iPhones, iPads, and Android devices. Now be advised that they no longer offer remote control features of the camera and microphone, or voice call recording, if you don’t need those specific capabilities, mSpy is probably your best choice for the price. They have been in service for several years, and have word class quality after sale customer service. Although the refund policy is strict, if you never actually used the service, refunds are granted without any issues, but you should ensure to check all compatibility requirements and terms before making a purchase.

        "body": "Hillstone Reviews, News and Tips  mSpy is complete peace of mind, in app form. There’s no escaping technology in today’s world and while its positives are all around us too, there is a negative side from which your children and loved ones need protecting. An unprepared parent or guardian may think it’s okay to let them have free roam, but you may need to think again. mSpy allows you to safely, securely and discretely monitor their activity on a range of devices. It not only gives you that kind of protection, but also produces useful graphics and analysis to help you not only see a snapshot of how a device is being used, but trends, changes and anomalies too. Many of us bought our children a cell for their own safety, and it makes perfect sense to give them a way to keep in touch when they’re out and about. However, it can become a burden being concerned about the many potentially unsafe ways their phones could be used. The solution to all this is the mSpy tracker app, which allows you to: monitor calls, messages and location. 1. Call Monitoring: mSpy allows you to see who was called, when and how often. You can also block numbers, including incoming calls from that number, to ensure certain contacts are off limits. You can also see who they have been calling, and have all this data presented in graphs to see trends over time. 2. Text Messages: see who messages are sent to and from and block numbers. 3. Location: track location including a history of when and where and for how long they have been in a location. You can also ‘Geo-Fence’ areas, setting your own custom locations which are safe (a relative’s house, for example) or no-go areas. VISIT THE OFFICIAL MSPY WEBSITE Tablets sometimes lack the call functions of a phone, but they share many apps and communication technology which can have even more risks associated with them than a regular phone. Many apps offer fantastic ways to keep in touch with nearest and dearest all over the world. However, it’s obvious how such technology could be misused. So, for complete reassurance, mSpy offers ways to monitor many big name apps. Free video calling apps, such as Skype or WhatsApp, give people face-to-face access to your child, so use mSpy to see a log of who was called and when. You can even review multimedia (pictures, videos) sent between users. Snapchat is well known for having a feature which can delete images a few seconds after they are sent. mSpy can recover this information, giving you access to images despite this. Other mature apps such as Tinder can have accounts set up by anyone, with no secure age verification. If your child has this app, you can view chat histories, who they’re talking to and what is being said – if you allow them to have the app at all! While all the above apps have legitimate uses, malicious use such as bullying is common on them. Use mSpy as a first line of defense against such problems. mSpy is compatible with all major mobile device operating systems. Yes! and while Kids may almost always be one step ahead when it comes to the latest technology, mSpy is an ace up your sleeve for when you need to keep tabs. The two most powerful features of mSpy is its screen monitor and keylogger. The former takes a screenshot of what’s going on, allowing you to see what’s happening at any given time. The keylogger keeps a record of every single keystroke made when they are logged on. This means that even if a message is deleted, a document is changed or their online history cleared, you will be able to see when has been written during their whole time on the computer. This is an incredibly powerful tool, giving you complete access to their interactions, online and offline. mSpy is a powerful tool. You might have reservations that this allows you access to something your child considers private. And, as adults, we have a right to privacy. However, children need to learn that privacy is not inviolable. It can be compromised for their safety. mSpy does not need to be kept secret, either. You have the option to make its presence visible and be completely open with them about the situation. Whatever your child’s individual needs and your parenting situation, mSpy can help you make their use of technology a safer and better experience. www.mSpy.com "

This feature can be very useful to monitor IM chat apps. 5. Support Overview. mSpy support is very professional and always tries to help you.",
        "body": " In this 2021 mSpy review, I will mention and describe all advantages and disadvantages of the mSpy app and in the end give you my conclusion. I will also compare mSpy with competition to show you is mSpy better or worse? Also. I will put everything in this mSpy review like buying, downloading, installation, features, and support overview, so you can find everything in one place. Hope you gonna like it!  Table Of Content [show]   1. Purchase Overview Purchasing of the mSpy app is secured. It provides you with the many different paying methods which are standard like VISA, MasterCard, American Express, Paypal, Bitcoin,… so this makes purchase fast easy and secure. Time to buy mSpy is about 2 minutes and it can be done 24/7 from any country all around the world. If we look at the price it is not cheap but it is not expensive either. An advantage is a low price to just try an app, and mSpy doesn’t have an alternative if you want to monitor iPhone as a no jailbreak solution. 2. Downloading Overview Compared to other monitoring apps, mSpy has many download advantages. First, the procedure is faster and easier. The biggest advantage of the mSpy app is that you don’t need to jailbreak iPhone or iPad in order to monitor a device. You don’t even need to download or install the app because of the mSpy no jailbreak feature. Also, if you want to monitor Android then the keylogger feature helps because it works even if you don’t want to root the phone and use root features. Time to complete the downloading procedure (including: enable unknown sources, disable verify apps, insert the download link, etc.) is approximately 1 minute. 3. Installation Overview Just like the FlexiSPY, the mSpy app also has the same installation advantages as: The installation is very simplified and installation wizard guide is excellent. It took me about 3 minutes to install mSpy so the download and installation procedure can be done in 4 minutes combined, in comparison with every other tracking solution, it is the fastest time to start. The last advantage is remote installation, rooting, and jailbreaking. This is an option and costs $37.99 but then experienced technician will do everything for you. You can also check my personal mSpy installation guide here. 4. Features Overview First I would like to note that all mSpy features work perfectly without any problems. The mSpy features list is long, so in this mSpy review I focused on a few special features such as: mSpy NO Jailbreak Feature If you decide to track iPhone or iPad activities with no jailbreak solution then the list of the tracking features is shorter but many advanced features are still included. Later in the review, you can see a precise list. You can start monitoring by setting everything up in the mSpy online control panel. mSpy is the only tracking app developer that allows this NO Jailbreak feature, but you won’t be able to track everything like you can when you jailbreak the phone. a. Instant Messaging Chat Apps tracking Later in the review, you can find an updated table where I list top 4 monitoring solutions and IM Chat Apps they support. The advantage of the mSpy app is that it supports some IM chat apps that other solutions don’t and also it can monitor iPhone WhatsApp, Skype, LINE, iMessage without being installed on the phone. b. GPS Tracking GPS tracking is the basic feature supported by all tracking solutions, but mSpy has the more-advanced option called Geo-Fencing. This feature alerts you when the target visits restricted area or leaves allowed area. Also, mSpy GPS tracking allows you to view all the places the target has visited, place address, view it on a map, and see the time of the visit. c. Keylogger mSpy is the only monitoring solution from top 4 that has this feature. It allows you to view all text messages that a monitored device received, even if the device isn’t rooted. This feature can be very useful to monitor IM chat apps. 5. Support Overview mSpy support is very professional and always tries to help you. The response is fast. mSpy support has 3 options:   mSpy - from $8.33/month  (5 out of 5)   1. Purchase Overview No disadvantages found. 2. Downloading Overview No disadvantages found. 3. Installation Overview It does not support BlackBerry and Nokia Symbian phones. There are no other disadvantages found. 4. Features Overview There is a lack of some advanced monitoring features like call recording, listening surroundings, and secret camera activation. However, there are also some advanced unique features that only the mSpy provides you can see up there in PROS. mSpy NO Jailbreak Features An iCloud backup option has to be enabled. If you want to enable iCloud backup you will need to take the targeted iPhone in possession and personally enable it. The procedure is very simple and it can be done in less than a minute ie. 30 seconds and you can find instructions here in mSpy installation article. a. IM Chat Apps tracking There are still few frequently used IM Chat apps that mSpy does not support but I would like to note that the list of supported IM Chat apps is constantly expanding so I believe soon mSpy will be the strongest IM Chat apps tracking solution. b. GPS Tracking No disadvantage found. c. Keylogger This feature also needs to be set up before it is ready to be used. I recommend you do this immediately after installation while you still have access to the phone. It can be done in less than a minute and I explained the procedure in this article below. 5. Support Overview The basic support solution is free but advanced options will cost you extra money. So there are 3 assistance options:    mSpy - from $8.33/month  (5 out of 5) Because you are here in the mSpy reviews article I can assume that you are interested in the mSpy Android and iPhone spy Abilities. Right? Even if that is not the reason I think you want to see answers on the questions like… …and etc. So to answer you on all that important monitoring questions that you might have about this ultimate Android and iPhone monitoring software I create this article. In this article, I want to show you my mSpy reviews about features, purchase, download & installation and support. So in this mSpy Review, you will be able to see all good and the bad points of this monitoring app and also I will compare it with the other Top cell phone monitoring apps. So let’s start with the most interesting part and it is the Feature Review. mSpy is the very powerful and advanced monitoring software which is on the market for a long time. It has many users all around the world and the app is constantly upgrading. Because of the many upgrades, I want to show you at the beginning of the mSpy review article, the currently full feature list. In the full feature list, you can see all the available features of the ultimate monitoring app. Also, below you can see the full overview of the most advanced monitoring app features. So here is the full feature list:  There are many features that are basic and advance. Here I wanted to detail explained only the TOP features which are unique or very advance. In the feature overview, I will compare mSpy with other top solutions and show its advantages and disadvantages. So in this part of the mSpy review and I will focus on these features:   1. mSpy NO Jailbreak Features mSpy was the first app that allows you new innovative mSpy No Jailbreak iPhone Remote Monitor feature. This is the best alternative to the remote install spy software for iPhone because it provides you the way to remote monitor on a cell phone without having it. The only app which has No jailbreak solution is Highster Mobile. But it’s feature list is less.  This is the mSpy NO jailbreak feature list for BASIC and PREMIUM users. The list is smaller than the full list but as you can see you will still be able to extract and know a lot of useful information’s about, for example, your kid. I would like to note that this is the best way to track your child cell phone without them knowing. I must mention in this mSpy Reviews iPhone that target iPhone or iPad doesn’t need to be jailbroken, no app installed and there will be no evidence. You can do the procedure to start monitoring by doing mSpy login, selection No jailbreak solution and adding… Also, there is one more requirement that needs to be mention and that is iCloud backup must be enabled. To find out more about these procedures check Phones spy installation guides I write for you from here:   Click here: mSpy installation article.   However, I can compare mspy app with only one top solution and that is Highster Mobile. Other top solutions do not provide this feature. Highster Mobile has some unique features, but the mSpy IM chats features are unique and great. As you can see mSpy premium subscription would be the winner for the No jailbreak solution because it has the biggest and more advanced feature list. Anyway, this is up to now the best way to find out where your kid was (wi-fi network), SMS logs, Calls logs, Social network activity, and other features.   2. IM Chats tracking  Instant messages monitoring (IM Chats) are this day’s basic feature. Children use them and if you want to secure them from online predators, you will need to monitor them. This app provides you with the very nice monitoring interface where you can see everything that the target has been sending or receiving and also information from or to who. As you can see from the picture you will also be able to extract… When I listen recording I was surprised because the quality is very high. Also, I want to mention that all tracking apps don’t support the same IM Chats. Here is the full list of IM supported chats for Top 4 monitoring apps in 2021. Here you can see that Spyera phone and FlexiSPY are in fact leading IM chats monitoring apps. mSpy is right behind these two apps but I have to say that this app IM Chats list has been constantly upgraded. Also, I have to note in this mSpy review that during the testing I saw that compared with the other best monitoring apps, mSpy has the advantages like: Highster Mobile as the cheapest solution has few unique IM chats supported. Now with the updated list of supported IM Chats and unique features, it is hard to say which one is a winner. The winner for you is the one that satisfies your monitoring needs. Here the app that supports the most IM Chats is Spyera phone. If you look at other characteristics then Spyera monitoring app would not be the winner. If you look for the no jailbreak iPhone or no rooted Android solution then the mSpy app has no competition and definitely, it is a winner. 3. GPS Tracking When we are talking about GPS features it includes…  Basic GPS logs feature to give you the ability to see all target visited locations. All tracking apps have it and it gives you information like:  Geo-Fencing is a little-advanced feature which alerts you when target visit restricts area or leave allowed area. This is a very useful feature because you are immediately informed when for example your child leaves home or school. This phones spy monitoring app provide you both GPS tracking abilities. If I compare this monitor app with other top monitoring apps like FlexiSPY, Spyera phone, and Highster Mobile, then I see that all concurrent apps provide you only GPS logs. So mSpy review conclusion is that here mSpy is a winner. 4. Keylogger  Keylogger feature allows you to view all text that has been entered on a monitored device. This feature is very useful for IM Chats tracking because you will view all messages that have been entered. Also, I have to mention in this mSpy review that this feature will also work even if the target Android phone isn’t rooted. mSpy provides their users with that feature and I find it very useful. This feature also needs to be set up before it is ready to be used. There is no tracking app that notes this requirement so I will write instructions here. Also, I would suggest you do this procedure when you are installing the app. So here are mSpy keylogger setup instructions: Ok, so once it is set up all inputs will be taken and uploaded to your online account. This monitoring app is here the top tracking solution which provides the best keylogger for Android and iPhone. FlexiSPY lately upgrade the app so it has new keylogger feature as well. Spyera phone has keylogger which only takes passwords and does not take keystrokes. On the other hand, Highster Mobile does not have this feature. So the only solutions which support Android and iPhone keylogger feature are mSpy and FlexiSPY. However, mSpy is a lot cheaper so if you are looking for the best keylogger app for the cell phone I recommend you this monitoring app. mSpy - from $8.33/month  (5 out of 5) In the purchase mSpy review, I will detail explain advantages and disadvantages of the spy app purchasing process. I got many questions about mSpy free download and is there some way to download mSpy free apk. So let start this mSpy reviews section with buying review and more precise answering on mSpy free download and mSpy free trial question. The answer to the mSpy free download is that there is no way to find it for free. There are no free trials and if someone provides you with mSpy free apk, mSpy free download app or mSpy free license key, note that is fake. So how can you still get the mSpy free app to try it? The best way to try mSpy for free is to buy it first and then refound it in 10 days refund period. This is the only real way to achieved mSpy free download and try its abilities before you decided to use it for a longer period.   Buying process consists of 3 simple steps which you will need to made a purchase: This is pretty identical steps which you need to do with purchasing of any other spy app so I can’t say that mSpy has something better or complicated compared to other spy software’s. Time which you need to make a purchase depend on your typing skills but let just say that it takes me 2 minutes to buy it. Sometimes I receive questions like: So in this part of the mSpy review, I would like to give you full details about supported countries. Ok, let’s start with the first question: Can I buy this monitoring app in India? Yes, you can. There are no restrictions and you can buy it worldwide. However, depending on your residence you will be provided with the different payment options as I will explain in the payment method review part below. The second two questions were: Can I use this monitoring app in Europe or Asia? The answer is yes you can. The only restriction is that the target phone has an internet connection to upload extracted information. You will also need the internet to do login and access your online account where you can see the extracted information. So this app is supported support for all users and all countries worldwide. On the other hand, mSpy is also a software that needs to be used for the legal purpose like: Also, there are different privacy laws in your country but these uses are legal in most counties. In the following part of the mSpy review, you will see which are the payment supported methods.    First I would like to provide you with a list of all payment methods that are supported to make the purchase:   That’s are secure purchase platform supported paying methods. I have to mention in the mSpy review that depending on your residence, different payment options will be provided to you. If I compare the tested monitoring app with other solutions, then there are differences. FlexiSPY support paying with cryptocurrencies, and Highster Mobile has BlueSnap supported paying methods. These paying methods are: All of these paying methods are standard and secure so you can choose the one you prefer the most. I can’t say there are highly advantage or disadvantage comparing payment methods. So choose the one that you prefer. What guarantee have I that this app will work?  The guarantee that mSpy works as it should is refund policy. You are always provided with the possibility to contact support for help and if they can’t help you to refund the software. If you definitely don’t want it, you can ask for a full refund within 10 days. This is standard procedure for all top spy software. For example here, are refund policies of the top spy software: The good news is that I rated mSpy support as a 100% good because they really try to help you. Here I would like to give you precise list of mSpy technical support assistance:< The newest feature is the mAssistance which provides you with remote root, jailbreak and install assistance. It is the same feature as FlexiSPYremote installation. It will take more time but you arrange a time when you will have target phone and then experienced technician do everything for you through Team Viewer. Other top spy solution does not provide you with remote installation feature and I consider that as an advantage. In just a few seconds, you will see the second most interesting part of the mSpy review and it is the price overview.   If you look at the mSpy price you see that it variate depending on the edition you use. BASIC 1-month edition costs $29.99 which is the very low price if we compare it with other top monitoring apps. However, this edition provides you only the basic features like… …and etc. Note that with basic subscription there are no advanced features like keylogger, Geo-fencing, Social media and IM chats monitoring. However, if you ask me, this is the cheapest solution to try some monitoring app and to find some useful information. On the other hand, PREMIUM 1-month edition cost $69.99. This is the more serious version with more spying features. It can compare to FlexiSPY and Spyera Android edition but it has fewer features if you root the phone. If you don’t root the phone then I would say the mSpy app is better because of the key Keylogger feature and lower price. Anyway, it has advantages and disadvantages which I explained in the feature mSpy review but let’s just say if you use mSpy No jailbreak solution and no root solution, then it is winner monitoring app. Here is the price table of the top monitoring apps.  In this part of the mSpy review, you will see the testing results. Here I will explain all requirements of the mSpy app, its advantages, disadvantages and also compare it with other monitoring software. Also, in this mSpy download overview, I will give you precise information about mSpy download duration.   1. Physical access To download monitoring app, you will need to have physical access to the target phone. Just like any other app, it needs some permission to be downloaded and installed on the cell phone and it can be done only if you have access. Also, I would like to note in this mSpy review that download isn’t needed for the mSpy no jailbreak no install and no access monitoring solution. However, access will be needed for about 1 min if the target iPhone doesn’t have activated iCloud backup. Many iPhone and iPad users have activated this option but sometimes they didn’t. iCloud activation instructions can be found in the how to install mSpy guide and here is the link: Click here: mSpy installation article. 2. Sim card changes There are no SIM restrictions. This means that the target can change the number and you will still be able to track him. Also, tested monitoring app provides you with the possibility to change target cell phones free during the subscription. This means that if the target changes the phone you can install it on other phone and still track him with the same license. 3. Internet connection Internet connection is required for downloading as well as installing the software. Also, it is needed for the monitoring software to upload extracted information on your account. You will also need it to log in on your monitoring app online account from where you will be able to see that information. Now let’s say what are specific requirements for Android and Apple devices. The second thing I want to show you in the mSpy review is the Android platform specific requirements. If you want to download and install mSpy on Android phone there is no need for rooting but if you want to use remote uninstall, email and instant Messages features then the root is required. The full list of features that require root access… …and etc. Basicly all social media and IM chat features require root permision but the list of unsupported features can variate from phone to phone. All other features will work without root access. Also, with keylogger app you can extract all keystrokes ie. send messages. If you want to learn more about what is rooting, and how to root the target phone fast and safe check our rooting guide:   More Information’s Here: How to Root the Phone?   The second platform is iOS. In this part of the mSpy review, you will see iOS specific requirements. If you want to download the mSpy app on the iPhone or iPad device it has to be jailbroken first. This is required because Apple device can’t download any app from different sources than the Apple store and this monitoring app download link isn’t Apple store.   More Information’s Here: How to Jailbreak iPhone/iPad?   However, this app provides you the way to monitor target iPhone without jailbreaking or installing or even accessing the phone. This solution is known as a No jailbreak iOS solution. Right now the mSpy doesn’t have concurrent here because it features for no jailbroken devices are far better than on any other products. In the feature mSpy review I will show you detail explanation about no jailbreak, no install, and no access feature so I suggest you see it. mSpy - from $8.33/month  (5 out of 5) The download file size of mSpy is 6.04MB. You can find it in Download folder with the name bt.apk. When you install this monitoring app, then the file size is 23.25 MB. I would like to note that the tested version was the PREMIUM edition for Android with all features and the app takes 14.33MB and the Data 8.93MB. So the total size is 23.25MB but it can slightly vary depending on the save extracted data before uploading. However, the total amount is approximately the same as a Highster amount but it is far less than FlexiSPY which app will take approximately 70MB and Spyera phone. Also, if you decide to capture fewer data save space will be smaller, In my case, I select to monitor everything.   Time to download mSpy depends on your internet speed. For example, in the United States, the average mobile download speed is 14.1Mbps. With the speed of 14.1Mbps, you will download mSpy file for ≈ 3.43 seconds. Time to do the whole downloading procedure (include enable unknown sources, disable verify apps, inserting the download link and etc.) will be approximately 1 minute if you know what you are doing. Ok, now let’s see the second part of the mSpy review and it is about installation advantages and disadvantages.  In the mSpy install overview or you can call it install mSpy review, I will give you the full view of important installation characteristics of this tracking app. First I will explain how many time it will take you to install mSpy, then I will tell you all installation advantages and disadvantages and on the end on which phones you will be able to install the app ie. which devices it supports. All reviews require comparison with other concurrent products so I will compare mSpy installation with other top concurrent products on the market. Time to install mSpy won’t vary a lot. It does not depend on your technical skills because it has no difficult require. All you need to do is to tap on next, accept and etc. I have the estimate that this process takes approximately 4 minutes and I include here mSpy login to the online account and taking the license key from the step 3 online wizard installation guide. If you read it before you will do everything within the 3 minutes. If we compare mSpy installation time (up to 4 minutes) with Highster Mobile (up to 5 minutes) it is a little less. FlexiSPY has approximately 8 minutes so it is almost double than mSpy installation time. Total time which you will need to download and install mSpy and Highster is approximately 5 minutes while the FlexiSPY procedure will take you at least 10 minutes.   The mSpy remote installation feature is as I say before optional, include rooting, jailbreaking and installing assistance. This feature cost $37.99 and it will take approximately 1 hour. Of course, you will have to arrange an experienced technician before and when you will have access to the target phone, the technician will do the rest. mSpy - from $8.33/month  (5 out of 5) The mSpy app has everything organized, the installation wizard guide is very good with all needed explanation. Also, the downloading and installing process is as simple as it should be and the install interface is very clear. If you ask me I like good design, simplicity and that is what this monitoring app interface provide to you. A Little disadvantage is that if you want Keylogger feature, it needs to be set up and the best time is of course when you install the software. There is no emphasis that it should be set before so I will provide you with instructions here too:   This procedure will take you less than a minute. This feature is actually very useful for everyone who doesn’t want to root the target phone because it will show you all IM chats even if the phone isn’t rooted.   This app supports and works perfectly with major mobile cell phone platforms. It can be download and install on the: Also, mSpy app can be used to monitor PC’s: Here I would like to note that mSpy, just like the Highster does not support BlackBerry and Nokia Symbian cell phones. So if you would like to monitor that phones you will have to use FlexiSPY or Spyera phone. In the mSpy login, I will focus on explaining the main characteristics. I will also compare that characteristics with other monitoring app’s and tell you this monitoring app advantages and disadvantages.   Login is required to access the online control panel. In this part of mSpy review, I want to show you all advantage and disadvantage of this monitoring app online interface. The control panel is well designed and it has the user-friendly interface where all options are intuitive. All you need to in order to see the extracted data is to click on some option. Here is the picture of the mSpy online control panel.  I personally like this software interface because it has a modern design and very good slide options. Along with some option comes blue character i. When you come on this character with the mouse then the instructions with the explanation show up and this is a nice way to save the space.  Everything is well structured so you can find all information’s in one place. Now let’s compare it with other tracking apps. mSpy app reload speed is very high. FlexiSPY, Highster, and Spyera reload speed is a little slower. mSpy and FlexiSPY have adjusted interface with more characteristic of modern design. mSpy offers more options than other apps. These options are: I find this options very useful. Also, with 1 click from your online control panel you are able to: This simplicity is key advantage in this monitoring app design. However, FlexiSPY and Spyera phone offer more features and it is understandable that there can be more difficulty in organizing logs. On the end, all monitoring apps have well-designed the interface so I would not give too much advantage any of them because it is personal preference. In just a few seconds you will see the last part of the mSpy review and it is about this monitoring app support that is provided to you.  The last part of the mSpy review is supported. Here I want to show you all the useful information about technical support which you might need if you get stuck at some point. Just as I said before this app support has 3 kinds of assistance: First, free support has very good technical service. The technical know their job and always will provide you with the best to help they can. If you ask them anything about the software they will reply you very fast. You can contact technical support on this mail: Technical Support: support@mspy.com Or submit a ticket from here: http://support.mspy.com/hc/en-us/requests/new If we are talking about phone support then I would like to note that this monitoring app has the best support of all other tracking solutions but it costs extra money $12.99. Live call technical support: Call number: +1 855 896 0041 There is also, the top support solution mAssistance which provide you with the top experienced technician who will remove root, jailbreak and install the mSpy app. This kind of assistance also costs an additional $37.99. but it is a good solution for everyone who is not highly technical and doesn’t know how to do some procedure. I would like to note in this mSpy review that they will give you steps on how to give them access through Team Viewer application. Once you give them access, they will do the download and install procedure for you. As you probably suspect it will take additional time. So if you are interested in mAssistance, prepare an additional 30 minutes of your time. Phones spy apps need to be constantly upgraded. The app monitoring facilities changes so here you will see changes in mSpy review 2021 compared with the mSpy review 2018. Also, I will show you prediction what can you expect in the mSpy review 2021. Ok, let’s start with the newest mSpy review 2021 changes. There have been differences in the app: 1. Cell Phone Spy abilities. Developer teams have been improving monitoring facilities so the newest app is now stronger than ever. In 2017 you could see that app get these features: As you can see in 2021 this app was improved with very advanced and requested monitoring features by customers. The customers mSpy reviews show that most demanding need is remote monitoring and support of the most used social media and IM chat apps. As you can see in my mSpy Review 2021 the developers listen to the customers and upgrade the app considering customer demands. 2. New Android and iPhone versions supported The Android and iOS platforms are constantly upgraded. In order to stay supported with the latest platforms, the developers need to upgrade the app constantly. As you could see in the support part of the review above this app currently support: The upgrades happen in 2021 too so the good news is that this monitoring app will certainly support all new platforms in the future. Did the Price Change? Also, one more good news is that price od this Phone Spy app did not change. So all new improvements which happen in mSpy review 2018 and mSpy review 2021 were not affected by the app price. To predict the future usually you might look at the past. Do you agree? So the past mSpy review 2018 shows that improvements have been made mostly in the list of supported social media and IM chats. Also, mSpy is focused on child remote monitoring. I can conclude that in the mSpy review 2021 you can expect: Also, there was one revolutionary feature that was first supported with mSpy and it is no jailbreak, no install, and no access monitoring. In the mSpy review 2021, I thig there will be more features that will be supported by this option. On the end, I have to say that this Phones Spy app has a long history. The developer team is experienced, good and they listen to customer demands. So in the mSpy review 2021 will certainly be the amazing one. Sounds good, does it? mSpy - from $8.33/month  (5 out of 5)   Ok and now my final words of the newest 2021 mSpy reviews. I carried… … and now I would like to say that mSpy is the monitoring app which will provide you everything that is written that it provides. It is not the most advanced but it is not weak. The price is lower and that is reasonable. After the testing I did, I would also like to say that it worth the money you need to spend. It provides you with some unique features that you won’t find in other products and the newest and advances are the iPhone and iPad No Jailbreak monitoring. Also, this app has great download and installation guides, great user-friendly and modern interface and one of the best technical support with the possibility to hire special mSpy assistance that will do everything for you. mSpy - from $8.33/month  (5 out of 5) It works as it should work. This is a specially designed app which can help you to monitor for example your child and I have to say that it will do the job it is designed to do. When I used her there were no… …so it stays stealth. When I try special commands from the online account like 1 click wipe phone, uninstall mSpy, Re-install app, Reboot or export logs, everything was working fine. There are no objections about mSpy app work so on the questions like “How good does mSpy work?” and “Does mSpy really work?” and “Is mSpy a scam?” I can say that mSpy work as it should and I can recommend it to everyone who is satisfied with its monitoring abilities. Right now mSpy is one of the Best Cell Phone Monitoring Software in the world.

Och med både jailbreak och lokala synkroniseringslösningar är det enkelt att komma igång. Android iOS Jailbreak-alternativ Alternativ för lokal synkronisering Om några frågor kvar  mSpy™ är den ledande programvaran för föräldraövervakning som gör att du kan se aktiviteterna på ditt barns enhet genom mSpy™ -kontot på din personliga smartphone eller dator. Dessa aktiviteter inkluderar textmeddelanden, platser, samtalsinformation och många andra.   mSpy ™ samlar in information (plats, sms, samtalsinfo, etc.) från ditt barns telefon och överför den till ditt mSpy™ -konto. För att kontrollera informationen från enheten du övervakar behöver du bara logga in på ditt mSpy™ -konto med vilken webbläsare som helst på din egen smartphone eller dator.   Eftersom vi har funnits på marknaden sedan 2010 har vi utvecklat ett starkt rykte som en av de säkraste övervakningsapparna. Vi värdesätter också säkerheten och integriteten hos våra kunder och deras nära och kära. Det är vår främsta prioritet. Vi använder de senaste krypteringsprotokollen för att säkerställa att din data är säker hos oss. Inte ens vårt eget team har åtkomst till data som övervakas av programvaran; det är bara synligt för dig.   mSpy™ är en helt laglig föräldrakontroll som har godkänts av många ansedda organisationer. Vi är dock inte behöriga att ge juridisk rådgivning till våra kunder över hela världen eftersom lagarna skiljer sig från land till land. Läs våra användarvillkor och kontakta en advokat om du har några frågor angående användningen av vår programvara.   mSpy™ fungerar över hela världen.   Alla enheter som har tillgång till Internet är bra för övervakning. När du har installerat mSpy™ på ditt barns telefon kan du se informationen från den telefonen genom din egen telefon eller dator så länge den är ansluten till Internet.   mSpy™ är kompatibel med alla Android-enheter (Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, LG, Motorola, etc.) och iPhones. Emellertid fungerar mSpy™ inte på gamla versioner av Androids och iPhones (köpt före 2010-2011).   Så snart betalningen är bekräftad får du ett e-postmeddelande med din inloggning och lösenord. Du måste följa länken i e-postmeddelandet och logga in på ditt konto med din dator eller smartphone. När du har loggat in guidas du genom installationsprocessen för att ställa in övervakning.   Du kommer att få inloggningsuppgifterna till ditt mSpy™ -konto direkt efter köpet.   Om du vill övervaka en Android (Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, LG, Motorola, etc.) måste du installera mSpy™ direkt på telefonen. Installationen tar dock bara upp till 10 minuter och du får en enkel steg-för-steg-guide efter köpet. Dessutom kan du när som helst kontakta vår tekniska support via chatt, och de hjälper dig med eventuella problem som kan uppstå. När mSpy™ har installerats kan du övervaka telefonens aktiviteter (sms, platser, samtalsinformation etc.).  Om du vill övervaka en iPhone behöver du telefonens Apple-ID och lösenord för att ställa in övervakning. Du kan behöva ha fysisk åtkomst till enheten i några minuter för att aktivera iCloud-säkerhetskopiering och få verifieringskoden. Processen bör inte ta längre tid än 5 minuter.   Efter installationen fungerar mSpy™ i bakgrundsläget. Ditt barn kan inte se att mSpy™ är installerat på deras enhet.   För att avinstallera mSpy™ måste man följa de specifika instruktionerna som endast våra kunder får efter köpet. Även om det försöker ta bort applikationen kommer du att få ett meddelande om det i din kontrollpanel.   Jailbreaking eller rooting av telefonen krävs inte för att mSpy™ ska fungera. En iPhone-jailbreak eller Android-telefonrotning krävs för att låsa upp funktioner för övervakning av sociala medier (Snapchat, Instagram, etc.). Med Android-telefoner kan du övervaka utgående meddelanden i alla sociala medieappar utan att rota.   Logga in på ditt mSpy™ -konto från valfri webbläsare för att se data som samlats in från den övervakade enheten.

        "body": "mSpy, the notorious software-as-a-device product which so far enabled two million plus people spy on their spouses and kids, is believed to be a victim of serious hacking. Last week it was discovered that massive data has been stolen from the company’s servers and posted on the Dark Web, revealing numerous emails, text messages, payment and location data to an uncertain number of mSpy “users.” mSpy is not entertaining requests and queries for five days now furthermore, KrebsOnSecurity cracked the hacking source but pity it was shared from a link to a Webpage only accessible via TOR, a technology that enables users to keep their actual internet addresses hidden and host Websites very difficult to reach or take down.  The Tor-based site hosts several hundred gigabytes worth of data chunks, taken from mobile devices running mSpy’s products, inclusive of about four million events registered by the software. The hackers who have claimed this invasion also unveil that this enormous data theft contains confidential information on more than 400,000 users, including Apple IDs and passwords, tracking data, and payment details on some 145,000 successful transactions. Although, the precise number of mSpy victims couldn’t be confirmed, but it is evident that insane amounts of sensitive data has been compromised which includes: photos, corporate email threads, calendar data and extremely private conversations. The huge data dump also exposes thousands of support request emails from people all over the world that paid between $8.33 to as much as $799 as various subscription charges to mSpy’s surveillance. It’s unclear still as to where mSpy is actually based; according to the company’s Web site it has offices in the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom, although there is no physical address given, the registration records show that the company is tied to a now-defunct firm called MTechnology LTD out of the United Kingdom. Documents related to the Companies House, at the UK show that the two founding members of the company are self-proclaimed programmers Aleksey Fedorchuk and Pavel Daletski, and that Daletski is a British citizen, and Mr. Fedorchuk is from Russia. Neither of the men could be accessed for comment. Court documents (PDF) attained from the U.S. District Court in Jacksonville, Fla. concerning a trademark clash referring to mSpy and Daletski state that mSpy has a U.S.-based address of 800 West El Camino Real, in Mountain View, Calif. According to these documents Daletski is a director at a firm based in the Seychelles called Bitex Group LTD. It is in fact amusing that the lawsuit was brought to light by Retina-X Studios, an mSpy competitor based in Jacksonville, Fla. that creates a product called MobileSpy. U.S. regulators and law enforcers have grown weary of companies that offer mobile spyware services similar to mSpy. In September 2014, U.S. authorities arrested a 31-year-old Hammad Akbar, the CEO of a Lahore-based company that’s responsible for a spyware app called StealthGenie. The FBI noted that while the company advertised StealthGenie’s use for “monitoring employees and loved ones such as children,” the primary target audience were cheating spouses. Akbar was later charged with selling and advertising wiretapping equipment. U.S. Attorney Dana Boente expressed his disdain in a press release for advertising and selling of spyware technology and called it a criminal offense and warned that such behavior will be dealt with an iron hand by their office. Akbar pleaded guilty to the charges in November 2014, and according to the justice department, that made him the first ever person to have admitted to criminal activity in advertising and selling spyware that invades a victims privacy in any way or form. As opposed to Akbar’s StealthGenie and some other mobile spyware products, mSpy advertises that its product works even on non-jailbroken iPhones, enabling users to log the device holder’s contacts, call logs, text messages, browser history, events and notes. According to mSpy FAQ if users purchase mSpy minus Jailbreak, and have the target mobile user’s iCloud credentials, then physical access to the device will not be needed, leave a few instances. Nevertheless, on purchase of mSpy for jailbroken iOS phone or tablet, 5-15 minutes of physical access to the device will be required for a successful installation. A public relations source from mSpy to KrebsOnSecurity in March 2015 stated that approximately 40 percent of the company’s users are parents willing to keeping tabs on their kids. The plan backfired badly because now they’ve unintentionally exposed their kids’ credentials to bullies, hunters and evil doers. Readers are asking us to provide leaked data link. I am sorry I won’t be sharing the link nor I will allow anyone to post the data here in comments. It’s users’ personal data and we should respect their privacy.

He previously worked as TNW's China Editor and LA Reporter. Follow him on Twitter or email him at josh@thenextweb.com.  Those of you interested in preserving your privacy will want to watch out for the mSpy app. When installed on an Android or iOS device, it can track phone calls, location data and keyboard strokes in the background without your knowledge. The app is ostensibly intended for legal monitoring use, and there are certainly legitimate reasons to install the software. Companies, for instance, could inform their employees that they’re surveilling company phones for security purposes, or concerned parents could include the software on devices they give to their kids. mSpy dances around the legal issue of surveillance with the following disclaimer on its website: My Spy (mSpy) is designed for monitoring your children, employees or others on a smartphone or mobile device that you own or have proper consent to monitor. You are required to notify users of the device that they are being monitored. Tickets to TNW 2022 are available now! However, elsewhere on the company’s website, the mSpy refers to the app as a bugging tool for gathering evidence, ominously referring to the user of a tapped phone as the “target.” mSpy also claims that its software is “100% undetectable,” which shouldn’t be necessary if everyone has been informed that they’re being monitored.   A sales rep said the following when I asked: After complete installation the application runs in a stealth mode, so it is undetectable and completely invisible for the target phone’s user Thankfully, the app requires physical access for installation. The iOS version requires that the client device is jailbroken, and it isn’t currently compatible with iOS 7 and recent versions of iOS 6 (6.1.3 and 6.1.4). mSpy for Android works with some of the platform’s most popular devices, including the Galaxy S4, Moto X and the HTC One, but spying on apps like Facebook, Skype, Viber and Whatsapp requires the phone to be rooted. Older BlackBerry and Symbian phones are also supported.   We’ve had to come to grips with the fact that the government has been spying on our phones, but now we also have to deal with the possibility that our loved ones and employers could be tracking us as well. Disconcertingly, mSpy claims to have over 1 million paid users. If you’re interested in using the software for a reason, plans start at $40 a month. I, for one, will be keeping my phone close at hand. Image credit: CoolKengzz / Shutterstock   "

As technology has grown in popularity, it goes without saying that it has also taken on a larger role in the lives of our children. While that’s good news for some parents, and bad news for others, technology is here to stay, no matter which side of the fence you fall. Smart phones are one device that many kids now have, and while we can debate the age at which a kid should get their first cell phone in another article, one thing that most of us can agree on is the importance of being able to monitor your child’s activities on their device.F For some, manually being able to check your child’s phone every so often is enough, but others need a better, high-tech option. Fortunately, there’s cell phone tracking software that can make the job a whole lot easier – with mSpy being the number 1 choice for parental control. It’s also used by companies to make sure they’re employees are staying productive. In this mSpy review, we’ll detail everything you need to know about their cell phone tracking software, so you can decide if they’re the right choice for your parental and corporate control needs.  mSpy is cell phone monitoring software, that gives you an inside look at what your children are up to on their smart phones. mSpy can give you piece of mind, knowing that your kids are staying safe, and that you’re able to keep an eye on their cell phone activity and not getting into trouble. It’s easy to install, and getting started is very easy. Once installed, you can use mSpy to track a number of different activities on your child’s phone, including: Think mSpy sounds like what you’ve been looking for?  mSpy can provide cell phone tracking services on Apple and Android devices. That means it works with the iPhone, and pretty much any Android compatible device. You can search your device on their website to make sure it’s compatible before signing up for their service. To install mSpy, you will need access to the target device to get started. Here are a few requirements for iOS and Android-based devices. If you want to install the regular mSpy app on an iOS device you will need to jail break the iPhone or iPad. This simply means you need to make it so you can install non-App Store approved apps onto the phone. The folks at mSpy can walk you through this process. You will want to make sure your iOS device can be jail broken before proceeding with this step – some newer versions can’t yet, and if you all into this category, see instructions below for using mSpy without jailbreaking your iPhone. Once your jailbreak is complete, you just log into your mSpy control panel to proceed with the install. The entire process, including the jailbreak should take 30 minutes or less. To install mSpy on an Android device, you will need to have authorized, physical access to the phone. Then, simply choose “Android” in your mSpy Control Panel and follow the install instructions. mSpy can be installed without rooting, but if you want to monitor apps like Facebook, Snapchat, Gmail, Facebook, and others, your phone should be rooted – connect with mSpy if you’re unsure what this means. In the past, if you wanted to install mSpy on an iPhone, you would have to jail break the device. Basically, this just means that you go through a process to remove software restrictions from your Apple device, so you can install apps that are not authorized by the Apple App Store. Now, you do not need to jail break your iPhone to use mSpy. You can still go the jail back route if needed, but mSpy offers a solution that doesn’t require that option, to the choice will be up to you. If you do opt for the non-jail break version of mSpy for iPhone, you’ll need to follow these steps to make it work: One thing a lot parents want to know is if their kids will be able to see that mSpy has been installed on their cell phone. The short answer is no – once installed, mSpy works in the background, is not visible from your child’s or workers’ device. On top of that, it’s secure; all of the data you have access to is encrypted and protected, and you will be the only person who has access to it. According to mSpy, their application is absolutely legal, and is designed to help parents keep their kids safe. It can also be used for corporations to make sure their employees are staying productive. That said, we’re not in the business of giving legal advice, so be sure to check with a legal expert in your area, if you have questions about the legality of mSpy or other tracking software. Before using mSpy, they say you need to make sure that your intentions to use their app meet the following legal guidelines. These are pulled directly from their website: It is your responsibility to determine whether you have proper authorization to monitor the device. It is also your responsibility to determine which disclosures, notifications, or agreements may be necessary in your jurisdiction, as applied to the specific facts and circumstances in which you want to use mSpy. If you have questions about the legality of using mSpy as you intend to use it, contact legal counsel of your choice. mSpy cannot provide legal advice.

        "body": "Monitoring apps for smartphones have many uses. Concerned parents want more control over their children’s activities, employers want to monitor employee movements, and some users have doubts about boyfriends or girlfriends. A spy app like mSpy is the ideal solution in such cases, therefore, in this mSpy review, we will cover all the important aspects a user needs to make a rational decision. Contents A spy app like mSpy performs its monitoring in two parts: The app is installed on the target device, registers everything that is going on here, and forwards the data to the user account of the person being monitored in the cloud. From here you can get the information you want by logging in using a browser. This works for real-time monitoring and the recording and subsequent control of text messages, movement sequences, telephone calls, or chats. Does mSpy Really Work? The mSpy app has been around since 2011. It was initially developed for parents who could use it to monitor their children’s cell phones. In the meantime, word has got around how useful and versatile the espionage app is. The mSpy software is compatible with numerous devices, including mSpy Android, mSpy iPhone. The range of functions with mSpy is so large that hardly any other monitoring software can keep up, and that with uncomplicated installation and operation because mSpy is available in several languages. mSpy impresses with extensive remote access. The spy app really reads out all processes on the monitored smartphone, so you can control WhatsApp and other chats with mSpy. They will then be forwarded to your user account, you can save the data you want and view it at your leisure. In addition, there is control of the microphone and camera and the location – even when the WLAN is switched off or the SIM card has been replaced! And that is what mSpy can do: There are now dozens of methods to communicate using social media apps from a smartphone or tablet. Monitoring text messages is no longer sufficient. Spy on conversations in all popular messaging apps, including WhatsApp, Tinder, Viber, Skype, Snapchat, Facebook, and many more is what matters these days.  GPS tracking is one of the most popular features. You can instantly locate your physical location within 5 meters using the phone’s built-in GPS function.  GPS fence can be used to create restricted areas for the target device. There is no limit to the number of zones that can be created. The phone automatically records when and how frequently each zone is accessed.  All incoming and outgoing calls from the target phone can be viewed in the mSpy control panel. You can listen to calls either immediately or later. You may view the call times, duration, their name, whether or not they are a saved contact on the target device and the overall number of calls. You may stop receiving annoying calls right now.  Monitoring and limiting websites is a popular tool among parents and employers. You can use this functionality to observe which websites the target device is viewing, which pages are bookmarked, and even be notified when certain keywords are entered into the browser. The monitoring app offers access to and blocking the contact list, as well as restrictions on websites and apps. You can also see all of the installed apps on the target phone in your mSpy dashboard. You can limit or unblock access to the application from this option. The list in your control panel will be updated as new apps are introduced.  Keylogging substitutes the conventional keyboard with a mSpy keyboard that records all keystrokes. By pressing the “Force Keyboard” button in your control panel, you can force this app to always load its keyboard.  mSpy dashboard provides access to a wealth of information about the target device. Some of these are merely informational, but there are a few key features included. Here is the data you can see:  Every email received and sent by the target mobile device is recorded and uploaded to the mSpy server. This setback helps to monitor all email activity that takes place on the target device, covering multiple clients including Gmail. As already pointed out before, as soon as MSpy is installed on the target device it runs completely invisible and stealth, in the background. The target user will not have even the smallest clue that they are being monitored. Some other notable features include; You can monitor all of this and much more from your web-based dashboard. This dashboard is available from a computer as well as from a mobile device. TRY MSPY NOW Installing the mSpy monitoring software on your phone is easy with Android phones or a tablet. You only have to get hold of the device for a short time. Install mSpy Instructions: ENTER THE MODEL OF PHONE OR TABLET TO CHECK COMPATIBILITY With the iPhone, you have the choice when installing mSpy – either you know the iCloud access data that the owner of the cell phone uses, or you have to get hold of the mobile device. If this is the case, you proceed with the mSpy iPhone installation as with the Android installation: The developers of the app provide a special version for installing the mSpy iPhone without jailbreaking. You need: Choose from the available offers for the no-jailbreak package from mSpy. After payment, you will receive an email with instructions. With the Apple ID and the login of the owner, you add the iPhone to be monitored to your user account. If you intend to monitor an Android (Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, LG, Motorola, and so on), you must install mSpy™ directly on the phone. However, installation takes only up to 10 minutes, and you will receive easy step-by-step instructions after purchasing. Furthermore, you can contact their tech support via chat at any moment, and they will assist you with any issues that may arise. You will be able to watch the phone’s actions after installing mSpy™ (text messages, locations, call information, etc.). If you want to monitor an iPhone, you’ll need the phone’s Apple ID and password to get started. To enable the iCloud backup and obtain the verification code, you may need to have physical access to the device for a few minutes. The entire procedure should not take more than 5 minutes.  Their rates are simple and clear, and they offer great value for the features you get. You pay only for the services you actually need and choose the duration of the terms according to your needs. All the features sought are in the Premium version. These services are also available for iOS without Jailbreak. One-month options are fine if you only need reports for a short period of time or just want to try the software. Of course, long-term options are cheaper. Still, it’s nice to be able to choose. TRY MSPY NOW Yes, mSpy has been a best-seller in this industry for many years. The list of available functionalities and the application itself are updated on a regular and periodic basis. Yes, the mSpy application can be completely hidden from the targeted user. It can be utilized in stealth mode, making detection on the phone being monitored extremely difficult. mSpy is compatible with Android and Apple devices, including smartphones and tablets. mSpy works with all manufacturers and types of Android phones and tablets and Apple iPhones and iPads. They have two versions for the iPhone: one for jailbroken devices and one for non-jailbroken ones. Yes, but only on iPhones that haven’t been jailbroken. It is necessary to physically install the application on Android phones and iPhones that have been jailbroken. Yes, mSpy is reasonably priced and has more starting functions than any other surveillance software. They have a long history of having over one million users. mSpy can be set up quickly and easily in around 5-10 minutes. It will take roughly 30 minutes to set everything up if you use their help service. Yes, however, you must buy a subscription for each device. You can, however, move your subscription to a different device at any time. Simply uninstall it from the presently monitored phone and reinstall it on the new one. Yes, mSpy is legal to purchase and use, but there are several key caveats. You can use it to track your children’s phones as well as employees who use company-owned cell phones. Yes, as long as your phone has an internet connection, it will work anywhere in the world. It is compatible with any internet connection, including Wi-Fi. If the phone does not have mobile data, it can still work with Wi-Fi; however, report updates may be limited, and services such as GPS tracking will not function effectively. The online control panel allows you to uninstall mSpy remotely. It is not essential to log into the monitored phone to delete the program. The application does not require Android rooting to function, although certain advanced functions must. Rooting is necessary if you want to monitor social apps like Snapchat, WhatsApp, and Facebook. You can configure it via the online management panel and choose a monitoring interval that is appropriate for your needs. Set it to update every half hour for accurate monitoring; this will prevent you from draining your phone’s battery and resources. Yes, an uninstall warning has been issued on the dashboard. If mSpy is deleted from the monitored device, it will notify you. One of the most prevalent characteristics of this covert software is that it rapidly drains the device’s battery. When the consumer notices that the battery life is no longer the same, they begin to believe something fishy is going on. While it is true that MSpy uses a little bit of battery, the consequences are insignificant. This was tested on both old and new devices, and no one could detect the difference, especially with commonly used cellular devices. TRY MSPY NOW mSpy customer support is available 24/7 via email, ticket, phone, and live chat. If you are not too tech-savvy and require assistance throughout the installation procedure, you can take advantage of a few specialized and paid services. These assistance services are as follows: Comprehensive and impressive FAQ page, demo video, and regularly updated blog filled with useful and interesting information are offered on the website. The support staff is well-trained professionals. Overall, mSpy is a proven service with a lengthy track record of performance. With over 10 years on the market, our tracking and monitoring technology has gained the trust of millions of consumers worldwide. Because it is available in a variety of world languages, mSpy is a valuable tool for any user. Furthermore, mSpy is completely legal spyware, thus it may be used to follow and spy on children or employees. TRY MSPY NOW Writer, gamer, and a tech geek.

        "body": "Does mSpy app really work? Is it reliable? Is it safe to use? In this mSpy review, I’ll provide some useful information to help you choose the best monitoring app on the market. Read it you can get a comprehensive understanding of mSpy phone tracker from the perspectives of its advantages and disadvantages. The following is our mSpy app review.  mSpy is an application which keeps track of the online activities of the monitored iPhone, iPad and Android devices. mSpy parental control app monitors call logs, text messages, GPS locations, multimedia files, Internet activity, emails, contacts, calendar and chat messages on Skype, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Facebook, Viber and more. You can view monitored data remotely via mSpy Control Panel. In order to use mSpy, you need to make sure to install mSpy on a compatible device. mSpy is available for iPhone and Android devices. However, if you want to use Premium mSpy™ features, you will need to root the target devices.   Platform:   Website: https://mspy.com  Domain Age: since 2011  Pricing: $69.99/Month Premium Package  Security Level: Not Safe: Spy Company got hacked – Stay Away!  It supports many logging features, and users can choose two versions. The basic version offers limited features which charge $29.99 per month. The premium version provides more features including GEO-Fencing, incoming call blocking, keylogger and so on. mSpy price of the premium version is $69.99 per month. mSpy app for Android lacks some advanced spying features such as listening to phone surroundings and call recording. It offers self-service, email/tickets support and live assistance which are free. The self-service is slow and the support team can’t solve some technical issues timely sometimes. Besides, it provides advanced customer service but you need to pay for it. The price of personalized customer assistance by phone is $12.99 and the advanced mAssistance package costs $53.99. The toll-free phone number is not accessible most of the time.    In summary, mSpy is a basic monitoring app that includes some useful features. It is easy to install and use. Nevertheless, we don’t recommend mSpy due to its security issue. But if you are willing to take the risk and afford the paid customer service, and you don’t need the features of listening surroundings and call recording, you can consider it as an option. Besides, there is no mSpy free trial. If you are in a hurry to install a monitoring app to start spying immediately before purchase, it cannot cater to your needs.

        "body": "Best Parental Control Apps » Guides » How does MSpy work? In this article we have an exclusive interview with Rachel Burhham, MSpy's CMO who will share with us all the details on how does MSpy work, how it started and how it became one of the leading parental control apps. With the recent rise of online usage among kids and teenagers, parents must be aware of the dangers that come with it. We have written in length about the dangers of the internet and how parental controls can give parents some comfort and knowledge on what their kids are doing online. Most of the platforms now allow parents to set parental controls to monitor their kids usage and manage screen time, however most of the privacy settings and internal parental controls are not enough and keep kids exposed to some of the dangers. One of the best ways to control what your kids are doing online is installing a parental control app or software that lets parents monitor closely who their kids are communicating with, how much time they spend on each app, block certain apps and content and even get notification on their kids whereabouts with special Geo location features. There are more than dozens of apps out there, but not all have all the features and some are easy to uninstall. One of the best and most comprehensive parental control apps is MSpy. You can read our extensive review of all the MSpy features here, and also compare it with other apps in our detailed parental control app comparison table. That said, we at ParentalControlNow wanted to learn more on the app origins, how does it work, what are the best and how it became one of the best apps parents can use. We had a long sit down with MSpy's CMO Rachel Burnham who answered all our questions about the Mspy product and how it can help you safeguard your kids. This century’s leap in technology brought new challenges into people's lives, questioning the way people used to protect themselves and their loved ones online. These new challenges sparked the need for an easily accessible solution. This is how the idea of mSpy was born. In 2010, the market saw a brand-new concept of the app that can both monitor online activity and use the data it gathers to protect the user from dangers coming with the use of the Internet.  In the early 2010s, the Internet was still somewhat uncharted territory for people. Children who were growing up together with the development of new technologies had no problems finding their way around. The older generation, however, fell a little behind. Parents, whose kids were already way more tech-savvy, had no idea what modern gadgets were capable of and how much personal information they contained. This situation created a little “parenting gap”. Our goal was to get rid of that gap and let parents continue to protect and raise their children using the most effective and up-to-date methods.  To put it simply – kids started overtaking the Internet. If before you’d have to wait until you’re around 15-16 to even get your first phone, these days, kids as young as 5 already freely use various gadgets that have access to the Internet.  We thought about how difficult it would be for parents to monitor what the kids are doing online and who they are talking to. The fact that terms like ‘cyberbullying’ and ‘online grooming’ quickly became synonymous with social media and the Internet in general, only proved that we needed something that can help parents deal with it effectively. Obviously, you can’t stand behind their backs all the time. So, we provided a solution that would help parents keep an eye on the child’s online activities remotely. mSpy can be installed on the device in two ways. For Android – you have to download and set it up directly on the target device. For iPhones – you can connect the app through the user’s iCloud account; you would need to input the iCloud credentials in your online mSpy account.  Once installed, the app connects to the phone’s storage and back up data and transfers it to our servers. All data is then displayed in the personal account of the user. mSpy is one of the most secure monitoring apps. All information extracted from the device is encrypted and securely stored. Even our team doesn’t have access to any of the information received from any of the devices. It is available only to the person who owns the account. mSpy also has the strongest Customer Support Department. Multilingual support teams are available 24/7 via various channels – emails, chats, phone hotline. There are also additional VIP support services like helping the user to install the application remotely through the Team Viewer, help with configuration, rooting, etc.  You can read the full MSpy review in our parental control app reviews section. In the beginning, people were really on the fence about monitoring apps like ours. Understandably, many see this as an invasion of privacy and a way to fuel people’s trust issues. However, over the years, our application has helped to prevent a lot of unfortunate and tragic things from happening to the kids who don’t fully realize how horrible the Internet can be. Consequently, our users started warming up to the whole idea of monitoring and now it has become a regular practice among parents to use parental tracking apps. The product changes depending on the user’s needs and the latest innovations in the industry. If there is a new social media app out – we’re already trying to figure out how we can monitor its data.  The Internet is a scary place even for an adult, let alone a child – you can never be sure who you’re talking to or where the next click will lead you. Younger kids spend a significant portion of their time online and it’s very easy for them to stumble upon a website or a video that is definitely not made for children’s eyes. Our application can act as an online filter that allows you to block any potentially inappropriate content or applications. Another problem is that children’s naivety makes them an easy target for online predators. In the eyes of a child, there is nothing wrong with meeting “their online friend” even if that “friend” is a creepy 40-year-old man. mSpy can help parents to keep an eye on who their child talks to online and prevent them from ever becoming another victim of online grooming. First and foremost, GPS tracking. It is always useful to see where your kid is, know whether they are skipping school or not, and simply have a chance to locate them in case you can’t contact them.  Keyword alerts. If the parents are worried that their child is talking about something inappropriate or is sharing too much personal information with strangers online, our Keylogger can help with that. You can add a list of keywords that you deem to be dangerous, and the app will notify you whenever they are used in conversations or search queries. Remote blocker. You can block inappropriate websites, applications, or incoming calls remotely without having physical access to the device. The most recent story that comes to mind is about a father who found out that his 15-year-old daughter was harassed by her classmates. He had installed mSpy on his daughter’s phone as soon as they moved since he knew that she might have a difficult time in her new school and wanted to keep an eye on the situation. Looking through her chats, he quickly discovered why his daughter looked so upset and tired recently. The messages showed that the boys in her class were constantly mocking and bullying her by sending inappropriate comments and threats through Snapchat and WhatsApp. They went as far as creating a separate group chat where they would send memes with her face accompanied by some horrible racial slurs. Needless to say, the father took immediate action and obliged the school to deal with the situation. Cyberbullying is something that a lot of parents are struggling to deal with these days. Since all of it takes place online and it’s the type of violence that doesn’t leave any visible physical traces, a lot of the times, parents have no idea that their kid is going through such emotional turmoil. What’s even worse, kids often don’t want to speak up about it themselves, leaving parents completely oblivious to what is happening in their life. That’s where software like mSpy can be of great help. Parental control apps were not made to “control” or “spy” on every little thing your child does online just as they were not made to substitute heart-to-heart conversations between you. Such software is merely a tool, and every parent decides to what extent they would want to use this tool. If you don’t want to pry into your child’s private messages, just opt for the features that don’t involve social media monitoring (like GPS tracking and different emergency alerts). That way you will only use the software when it’s really necessary. We also encourage all parents to be honest with their kids about installing such apps on their devices. Yes, this might not be an easy conversation, they will probably get angry, but they need to understand the motives and the importance of your decision. You can also negotiate some ground rules concerning the use of the app and let them set their own conditions. Social media monitoring is definitely what people are looking for the most since that is where we might share the most sensitive information. Tracking chats on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Kik, etc. helps parents make sure their kids don’t share any personal details with strangers online and are not being cyberbullied or harassed. Geofencing is a close second. The feature allows you to set “safe” and “danger” zones on the map. The user will get an alert if the target device is tracked in the forbidden area. We want to thank Rachel for her time and the detailed answers and hope this can help parents better understand how to protect their kids on line.   A concerned 46 year old father of 3, ages 16, 12 & 9, Computer scientist \"As part of my parenting quest to keep my children safe in the online world, I've researched and tested many parental control apps.

From sex predators to identity thieves, many criminals lurk in cyberspace and can take advantage of them. That’s where mSpy comes in. It’s a spy cell tracker that monitors the online activity of your kids. The mSpy software can provide you with valuable insight into what your children are doing online. While you may worry about violating their privacy, knowing their browsing history, app usage, and social media conversations can help you protect them from online dangers. Like other robust spy apps for kids, mSpy can hide itself from the targeted device owner. The app’s been around since 2010 and has a headquarter in London, England. It’s undergone several performance/usability enhancements over the last decade and earned recognitions such as the Top Ten Reviews Cell Phone Monitoring Software Silver Award and the kidSAFE® Seal. mSpy has been featured in numerous high-profile publications, including the Los Angeles Times, Forbes, Tech Times, The Next Web, Phandroid, Android Headlines, and AndroidGuys. And it has graced the online pages of the Parents Television Council, Working Mother, and Fatherly. There are 2,306 mSpy reviews on Trustpilot. With a star rating of 3.9, thousands of users have considered it great. While you can find fewer mSpy reviews on Sitejabber, its contributors have collectively given the software 3.9 stars too. Let’s take a look at whether these ratings are fair and accurate. Here’s an overview of mSpy’s compatibility and overall functionality. mSpy supports Android 4.0 and higher iterations and all iOS versions. All iPhones, Samsung, Huawei, LG, Motorola, and Xiaomi devices released after 2011 should be able to run mSpy. But to be sure, use the Compatibility Checker to determine whether your target phones and tablets support the app. But not all mSpy features are available in both iOS and Android. Address Book Scanning Once installed, mSpy can scan the linked device’s address book and track new and existing numbers. mSpy Tracker can record all incoming and outgoing calls. The app can also capture key information like timestamps or call duration. With access to the target device’s address book and chronological data on calls, you know which individuals your child spends time with on the phone. Besides phone calls, the mSpy tracker also gives you access to sent, received, and deleted text messages. With it, you can find out if your kid is sharing inappropriate content or information with somebody, and vice versa. Similar to other widespread monitoring solutions like WebWatcher, mSpy can monitor different messaging and social media apps. Besides signing up for the Premium or Family Kit plan, you may also need to jailbreak or root your device to unlock this advanced functionality. Check out the list below to know which features are compatible with which mobile operating systems. As you can see, jailbreaking or rooting is a prerequisite for monitoring most messaging apps. Doing so can be challenging if you lack technical expertise. But there’s no shortage of how-to articles and videos on the internet you can consult. If you don’t want to do it alone, you can hire a mSpy expert via mAssistance. With this parent spy app, you can virtually follow your child. mSpy can track your kid’s whereabouts, show you a route history over a specific period, and provide you details such as addresses and coordinates. You can see all past and present locations. With this advanced feature, you can create safe and no-go zones and receive email notifications whenever your kid enters and exits them. It comes with a map that can illustrate the historical movement of your child. This iOS and Android device monitoring solution can give you the names and versions of all the apps installed on the target device. Knowing what apps they use can help protect your kid from harassment, photo shaming, subtweeting, vague booking, and other forms of cyberbullying. As a Premium or Family Kit package subscriber, mSpy lets you remotely block apps that you deem age-inappropriate to help keep strangers at bay, minimize exposure to bad influences, and reduce distraction. Using the app’s keylogging functionality, you can see what your kid typed on the target device. This advanced feature can be a lifesaver, for it can help you determine whether your child is interacting with malicious characters. One of the biggest benefits of the Premium and Family Kit plans for Android – you can use mSpy to take screenshots of your kid’s conversations on social media and messaging apps. Opening any supported messaging app activates it. mSpy can display the screenshots it takes only within the next update, so you won’t be able to see them all in real-time. With mSpy, you can browse through the photos, and videos saved on the target device. Complete with data and time stamps, you can access them from the mSpy Control Panel. mSpy can monitor the web browser activity on the target device. You can see a complete log of the sites your child visits and bookmarks. Using this advanced feature, you can limit what your child can look at online. It acts as a pornography blocker, but you can also restrict access to other age-inappropriate sites. In addition to that, this feature enables you to set smart screen time rules to help your kid develop healthy web browsing habits. Paid subscribers can use the mSpy app for iPhone or Android to track the Wi-Fi hotspot connections in your child’s smartphone or tablet. With such insight, you can discover the locations your kid visits or find potentially unsecured hotspot connections. If you don’t want your child looking for specific terms, you can set the mSpy cell phone spy software to notify you when those keywords or phrases are used. If you link an Android device to the mSpy app, you can see the emails your kid receives and sends. If you spot any phishing emails, you can insulate your young one from scams.  This feature also shows you if explicit content reaches your child’s inbox and take precautions soonest. With this mSpy iOS and Android feature, you can keep tabs on your kid’s calendar activity. The sooner you notice a suspicious entry, the faster you can do something to protect your child. This cell phone monitoring app can scan the contents of your kid’s Notepad on Android. This way, you can quickly sift through notes and spot any cause for concern in to-do lists. The home screen of the dashboard displays the target device’s remaining battery and type of internet connection. Apart from basic device information, the home screen of the dashboard also features the following details:  On the Device Management page, you can adjust different monitoring settings. You can tell mSpy to keep a log of data gathered through all connections or Wi-Fi only and disable/enable certain features. Also, it’s possible to change update intervals for locations and other sources of data. As you wish, you can export records or clear logs. Find out exactly when and why mSpy gets unlinked to your target Android device. Although getting disconnected doesn’t necessarily mean that the phone monitoring app was uninstalled, this feature can eliminate guesswork. If you sign up for the Basic or Premium plan, you can link one mobile device at a time. Subscribing to the Family Kit package extends the number to three. Despite this limitation, you’re free to change target devices unlimited times. It would’ve been better if you could link multiple electronics at the minimum. But at least you don’t have to purchase an additional license when your kid gets a new smartphone or tablet. Now we’ve looked at everything the software offers, let’s see how to get started. The mSpy installation and setup process varies between iOS and Android. To unlock certain mSpy iOS or Android features, you may have to jailbreak or root your target device first. To successfully link a mobile device to your mSpy account, it should: There’s one exception to the rule, though. Physical access isn’t needed to install the iPhone monitoring app version when you have the target device’s iCloud credentials. However, this only works if there is no two-factor authentication enabled. While writing this mSpy review, we tested the app with an Android-powered Huawei device. To give you an idea of how to set it up, we followed these steps: The mSpy Wizard provides a clear step-by-step guide. You don’t have to be tech-savvy to finish everything in about 10 minutes. If you need to root an Android device to access the other features, you’ll have to perform additional steps. When it comes to customer support, this cell phone monitoring app is synonymous with choice and quality. It’s available around the clock and in several languages. As follows are your options. mSpy provides three knowledge bases: FAQ, Blog, and Help. FAQ consists of general, purchase-related, and installation-related questions. It has a dedicated page, but you can also find it on the homepage. The mSpy Blog includes many interesting reads about parenting advice, cell phone monitoring tips, app updates, industry news, and reviews of mSpy alternatives. Help has a search engine and can fetch keyword-based articles. Although Help returns a few results (a sign of a limited database), it can load relevant results on its floating window instead of opening a new browser tab. You can speak with a live mSpy representative when you click the floating Chat button on the website. If you see the Help button instead, run a search and then click Live Chat. Besides conversing with a customer care agent, the Live Chat option also allows you to attach files, edit your contact details, email transcript, turn on and off audio notification, and submit a support ticket.  If you don’t have the time to chat with an mSpy representative, you can send an email instead. Apart from submitting a support ticket through the mSpy dashboard or website, you can message the company via a third-party email service. mSpy has dedicated email addresses for sales, technical support, billing, press and media inquiries, and affiliate program questions. You can follow and engage with the company with its Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts. mSpy has a few different phone support options, including: If you’d like to speak with an mSpy sales rep in your native tongue, it has special hotlines in the United States, Mexico, Brazil, France, Portugal, Czech Republic, and Turkey. Only callers based in the US and Czechia can get a representative on the line around the clock. For payment-related issues, mSpy provides a toll-free hotline for customers in the US and Canada. With this paid service, you can get personalized phone assistance from mSpy. You can carry out the installation and setup of the Android and iPhone monitoring app under an expert’s guidance every step of the way. mSpy provides multi-language support, so you don’t have to be a native English speaker to benefit from this service. Delivered via TeamViewer and available 24/7, you can use mAssistance to hire a technical expert for: Once purchased, you can use this add-on for life. Even if you cancel your mSpy account and sign up again in the future. mSpy and FamiSafe share many basic monitoring features. And unlike the last time we compared them, we’ve verified that mSpy can now control screen time. Jailbreaking is needed if your target device runs on any iOS version from 7.0 to 9.1, though. In terms of device compatibility and connectivity, FamiSafe has the edge over mSpy. FamiSafe supports not just iOS and Android but also Windows, macOS, and Kindle Fire OS. Also, you can link 5–30 devices to this parent spy app. With mSpy, you can monitor three devices at most. Strictly speaking, both mSpy and FamiSafe use a tiered pricing model. But the latter offers one plan and limits device connectivity only. In other words, you can get all monitoring features and increase the number of devices. Unlike mSpy, FamiSafe doesn’t require jailbreaking or rooting. However, it has no tracking capability for messaging apps. mSpy has no direct answer to FamiSafe’s YouTube monitoring and driving history reporting functionalities. But the mSpy cell phone spy software can give you control to remotely block the popular video-sharing app and generate comprehensive, downloadable reports on user activity. One significant disadvantage of FamiSafe installation is that physical access to target devices is always a must. With mSpy, you don’t need to hold iCloud-activated iPhones to pair your account if you have the login details. mSpy stands closer to Cocospy than it does to FamiSafe. They both support geofencing and keylogging and are compatible with similar mobile operating systems. Likewise, they require physical access to iPhones if you don’t have the corresponding iCloud login credentials on hand and if two-factor authentication is activated. Cocospy can match (or even exceed) mSpy’s monitoring capability, for it can track everything the other can. Like the mSpy for iPhone, Cocospy doesn’t support Google Hangouts. But it can capture conversations in more social media and messaging apps, such as:  Besides, Cocospy’s SIM card location tracker and SIM card change detector have no mSpy equivalent. Cocospy doesn’t require roofing or jailbreaking whatsoever. But the screenshot-taking capability is sorely missing in its feature sets. The mSpy software has it, which is instantly available for use in unrooted Android devices. No Cocospy version requires rooting or jailbreaking. But you may have to unlock its unadvertised screenshot-taking capability. mSpy’s Screen Recorder is instantly available for use in unrooted Android devices. Cocospy brags about its stealth functionality to avoid detection. At less than 2MB, there’s no questioning how light it is. mSpy can’t make a similar claim, and it acknowledges its tendency to drain a device’s processing power. That’s why a lighter version of the mSpy family phone tracker exists. Cocospy offers three separate subscription packages for iOS and Android. It also comes with a plan for businesses. mSpy sells three subscriptions but doesn’t charge per operating system. Cocospy’s pricing strategy gets confusing if you intend to interchangeably or simultaneously target iPhones and Android devices. Both companies offer multiple billing options and going with mSpy is usually more expensive. But Cocospy lacks six-month licenses, which is why mSpy provides greater flexibility. Either offer a money-back guarantee, but Cocospy is willing to give you a refund if you cancel within 60 days. mSpy can only wait 14 days. If you wish to pay with Bitcoin, you can do so with Cocospy. You can only use Google Pay, a credit card, or a debit card to purchase mSpy. In the customer support department, mSpy is hands down superior. It provides more options and is more responsive. mSpy and FlexiSPY are both excellent at bugging electronics. However, the latter takes spying to extremes. There’s nothing mSpy can do that FlexiSPY can’t. Besides basic and advanced monitoring capabilities, FlexiSPY can intercept calls, record voice conversations, and use a target device to listen to its surroundings and send fake text messages. Moreover, FlexiSPY supports mind-blowing remote commands. In most cases, mSpy’s ability to block apps and websites is good enough. But with FlexiSPY, you can remotely restart the target device and enable and disable certain features. Also, you can uninstall or deactivate the app from afar. What’s even crazier is that you don’t necessarily need an internet connection to pull all of this off. FlexiSPY is a few spy apps for kids that can remotely control the target phone, tablet, or computer via SMS. mSpy and FlexiSPY have a conditional refund policy and require jailbreaking, or rooting to maximize features.  But unlike mSpy, FlexiSPY doesn’t have a family plan. Although this spy cell tracker is compatible with more platforms, it sells specific plans for Android devices, iPhones, iPads, and Windows and macOS computers. You can only link one phone, tablet, or computer to FlexiSPY at a time and buy a different license when targeting a new device. mSpy doesn’t have this costly and inconvenient limitation. You can simultaneously pair up to three devices and switch from Android to iOS (and versa) without changing plans. FlexiSPY and mSpy offer diverse and responsive customer support, professional installation assistance as an add-on, and tiered pricing. FlexiSPY’s packages are usually more affordable. But they’ll only cost more if you don’t target devices of the same kind of operating system. Primarily, mSpy is available in two plans: Basic and Premium. There are four billing options (monthly, quarterly, semiannual, and annual), but you may not be able to choose them. As a non-subscriber, you may be able to pick from Monthly Basic, Monthly Premium, Quarterly Premium, and Annual Premium packages only. The rest of the billing options will just be accessible after you make the purchase. Even then, not all billing options for both plans are readily available. When you click Purchase New Package on the cloud mSpy dashboard, we can unlock the quarterly and annual Basic subscriptions. But when you click the kebab (three vertical dots) icon on the top right-hand corner and go to Billing, the biannual option will suddenly be part of the selection. We don’t understand why the company has decided not to advertise every mSpy price openly. It’s almost as if it wants to continue offering said billing options on paper, but doesn’t wish customers to pick some of them. Our mSpy review also has to mention the mystery around the Family Kit package. You can read about it on mSpy’s site, but you won’t find any details about its price, nor can you sign up for it. You’ll have to ask customer support about it. In our experience, the representative gave us two purchase links to the semiannual Family Kit and Annual Family Kit. This elusive package isn’t available in monthly and quarterly subscriptions. Nevertheless, you’ll get a discount if you agree to pay multiple months in advance. The longer the plan, the more you save. Have a look at the mSpy pricing below. mSpy sells two add-ons: Support Priority Line for $12.99 and mAssistance for $53.99. Each of them comes with a one-time mSpy cost. Once purchased, either add-on is available for life. Even if you cancel your mSpy subscription and sign up again in the future, you won’t have to pay another fee to use Support Priority Line and mAssistance. In terms of payment, mSpy supports Google Pay and accepts any debit or credit card that bears the Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express, or JCB logo. Irrespective of your chosen plan, auto-renewal is enabled by default to prevent any interruption of service when your subscription expires. But you can turn off this option and manually renew your package. You can buy up to eight mSpy licenses per transaction. If you wish to buy more, you’ll have to contact the company’s sales team. At the moment, the mSpy trial version isn’t available. Admittedly, sharing your payment credentials without having to try any premium software first isn’t ideal. But at least you may get a full refund if you cancel within 14 days from the date of purchase. Although the company likes to call it a “money-back guarantee,” its refund policy has too many conditions for it to be considered as such. The list is exhaustive, but mSpy will generally reject your request if: If you wish to see mSpy in action before you subscribe, check out its interactive demo instead. Or if mSpy seems too pricey or a bit impractical for you, consider mLite. Think of mLite as a watered-down version of the mSpy iPhone and Android tracker because of its limited functionality. But it has a unique feature called Panic Button, a one-click cry for SOS your kid can use in case of emergency, you can. Also known as Find My Family, mLite costs just $14.99 a month. Unlike its souped-up counterpart, this mobile app comes with a three-day free trial. You do need to choose your payment method before you could give it a whirl. The company wants to know how to bill you beforehand to charge you immediately once your free trial lapses. Overall, it’s one of the affordable options on the market. mSpy is a decent spy app. It’s not the most discreet with how it consumes battery power, nor is it the most impressive with its relatively few advanced features. But it’s capable of safeguarding your child from the dangers of the internet. At the risk of repeating the usual sentiment of mSpy reviews, the company has stellar customer support. Its premium expert installation and setup assistance is a huge time-saver. Also, it’s protects not only your kid, but your data, too – everything is encrypted. We wish that mSpy would advertise all of its pricing options from the get-go, but it’s forgivable. After all, the company won’t force you to sign up for multiple plans just for changing mobile platforms. If you haven’t tried any spy apps before, mSpy won’t disappoint you. Yes, mSpy delivers on its promises. But the functionalities you can use depends on your device’s operating system. Also, some advanced features are inaccessible without jailbreaking or rooting. To maximize the app, you must complete all of mSpy’s installation and setup requirements. If you set it up correctly, the target device’s user won’t be able to spot any evidence of the app’s installation. However, it may noticeably drain the battery since it runs constantly. But your child could have a hunch that you installed something in the smartphone or tablet if you show any indication that you’re spying on him or her.  The most affordable mSpy plan is Basic, which costs $29.99/month or $99.99/year. The other package for individuals, Premium, will set you back $69.99/month or $199.99/year. Currently, the mSpy app free trial is unavailable. But you can view a software demo to see how it works. mSpy is an excellent spy app, but it isn’t the only software of its kind on the market. You can find parental control apps with comparable features with more affordable plans, have broader device compatibility, and have greater support for simultaneous connections. Read this article in full to find out why there’s an abundance of glowing mSpy reviews and how it stacks up against leading mobile device monitoring solutions. ABOUT AUTHOR Deyan G.

        "body": " Home Mobile iPhone Apps The 10 Best iPhone Spy Apps [January 2021] TechJunkie Expert Recommendations           Given how important our smartphones are to our everyday lives, it makes sense that we want to protect ourselves while we use them. Some of the iPhone spy apps in this list are a bit of fun while some have a serious use. Likewise, some require jailbroken phones, while others are able to be downloaded right from the App Store. Whatever the reason you want to use a spy app, these are some of the best around. Before you use any of the apps on this list, make sure you review your state or country’s policies on privacy and tracking. When you download and use these apps, you’re taking responsibility into your own hands. With that out of the way, let’s dive into the list!  Compatible With Most of the apps on this list allow you to spy on someone directly using the phone, but if you’re looking to spy on others, a spy camera is a great way to do it. If you can afford the $10 app price, SP Camera on the App Store is the perfect app for capturing footage stealthily. SP Camera is simple: there’s a movable and resizable camera viewfinder on the app that can be hidden with other fake apps, including a calculator, a reactive webpage, and much more. The app is chock full of recording features that allow you to customize how videos and images are collected, including multi-lens support and slow motion recordings. If you’re looking for the best spy camera app for iOS, this is it.     mSpy is a very powerful iPhone spy app that is completely undetectable once installed. It includes a keylogger, call monitor, website blocker, geofence alert to let you know if the handset enters a location you don’t want it to, chat logger that works with WhatsApp, GPS tracker, internet monitor and remote control. The app also comes with 24/7 customer service. mSpy has three different subscription options depending on your needs.    iKeyMonitor is a keylogging app that collects data from SMS, WhatsApp, websites and more. If it’s typed into the iPhone keyboard, it is recorded in this app. The app installs quickly and silently and will sit on the phone invisibly recording every keystroke. It can also capture screenshots to show you what’s going on as well as what is being typed. The app will then email you a report of keystrokes iKeyMonitor is quite expensive but comes with a three day free trial so you can try before you buy.    Xnspy is similar to the preceding two but it quite a bit cheaper. This iPhone spy app can monitor calls, keystrokes, track the phone using GPS, secretly record using the microphone and alert you when particular words are typed or mentioned. The real strength of Xnspy is that it happens in real time so even if the user deletes chats and call logs you will still see them. Xnspy is available for non-jailbroken and jailbroken iPhones.    The Mobistealth iPhone Spy App is another great app that logs chats, SMS, call logs, images, videos, web history and more. You can also activate the microphone to listen to calls or conversations, use GPS, Wi-Fi or cell tracking to find the location and more. It works on both non-jailbroken and jailbroken iPhones and is completely silent so the user should never know what’s going on. Mobistealth iPhone Spy App is also expensive but comes with a free trial.    FlexiSPY is another fully featured iPhone spy app that does everything from monitor keystrokes to record calls, track its location and more. FlexiSPY also includes remote control options so you can remotely switch on the video camera or microphone to record what’s going on at the time. You can also make changes to the phone remotely for on the fly control. FlexiSPY does work on non-jailbroken iPhones but works best on jailbroken ones.     Compatible With An app so great it was featured in USA Today, Spy Phone is one of the best phone trackers you can find on iOS today. Built to share all the important information with you that you could basically ever require, Spy Phone gives you info on everything from contacts to messages and, of course, location tracking. Not only does the phone allow you to keep track of your phone in case it’s misplaces, but the phone can also track your kids or other family members. It’s a solid offering, even if most of it is managed within a browser and not the app itself.   SpyEra is one of the most comprehensive iPhone spy apps out there but is also one of the most expensive. It can listen to or record live calls, record Skype calls, record SMS, chats, IMs, social media use, Facetime, record all keystrokes and even grab passwords from the phone. It is undetectable to the user and offers full control over the device and full monitoring over everything that is done on the phone. SpyEra needs a jailbroken phone to work but offers a huge range of features in return.    Compatible With SP Camera is a great app for taking secret photos when you’re out and about, but if you’d rather focus on protecting your stuff at home, Alfred Camera is the app for you. Alfred makes it easy to use your old smartphones and other technology to get total security of your house. From live monitoring on your current devices to using the speakers on your phone as a makeshift alarm, Alfred is basically a must-have—and believe it or not, the app is free with in-app purchases.

        "body": "People nowadays live a dual life — personal and professional. That’s why people prefer having two different phones for work and personal needs. in most cases, employers have to provide the work-based phone. While it’s a necessity, there are some nightmares to take care of. You don’t know if the device is being used against your company. Also, you have no idea when the employees start using the device and connection for their own needs. Of course, you cannot keep checking employee devices on a regular basis. And, here comes the need of a remote smartphone monitoring or spying solution. Wouldn’t it be awesome if you can monitor what your employees using the work-based devices for? In the same way, it’s great to know if your children are misusing the device or internet resources. mSpy is the one awesome solution for both these scenarios. In this article, we are going to have an in-depth review of this smartphone monitoring software. As an employer, I’ve been using mSpy for the same surveillance purpose and it has helped me a lot. And, when I’m a parent, it gives me the complete freedom to know that children aren’t going through inappropriate ways. In short, I can share with you a detailed and personal review of using mSpy.  Table of Contents [hide]   mSpy is a legal, multi-platform and popular smartphone monitoring app. It does not offer a free version, but the product is loved by conscious parents and employers alike. One thing about mSpy is that it’s available for Android, iOS, PC and Mac. Yes, at some point, if you want to start monitoring a PC or Mac, you need not to purchase other products or services. So, if you ask us, mSpy is one of the comprehensive and feature-rich device monitoring services in the market. In this article, however, we will be considering its Android and iOS sections only. If you are not yet satisfied about credibility, you should check out mainstream web media. mSpy is praised by many publications like The Next Web, Forbes, The Huffington Post and CNN. Everywhere, it’s dubbed as a superb package to monitor smartphones and other devices. They also mention the trustworthiness and un-detectability of this monitoring package. We believe these are enough to get started with mSpy. Now, it is time to move onto the various sections of this spy software. We will take a look at compatibility first — so you can start with assurance. Before you purchase, you have to make sure that it works on your employee’s/children’s smartphones. The official requirements of compatibility are as follows. We will also mention the minimum specs for Mac and PC monitoring — just in case. Check out mSpy Compatibility Here Installation and set-up of mSpy depends on the device and platform. We will have an overview about each cases. This is all about the installation aspect of mSpy for Phones. The steps are very simple enough for even the beginners. You don’t have to worry about any technicalities either. So far, we are impressed with the way mSpy works for common users out there. Compatibility of mSpy for iOS depends on whether the device is jailbroken or not. Let’s keep this differences apart, so that you would know what you need. Unlike many smartphone monitoring software out there, it’s possible to spy using mSpy even when your iPhone hasn’t been jailbroken. This is the simplest and easiest way to install mSpy and start spying on the target device. Here, mSpy uses a direct connection to iCloud for getting logged information. So, you would not need physical access to target device for installation and monitoring. The best part is that you just need the iCloud credentials of the person to be spied on. If you are going to spy on your children or employees, grabbing the credentials would be an easy task. If you are spying without jailbreaking, you will have basic features only, such as Call Monitoring, SMS, WhatsApp Monitoring, Browsing History, Events and Notes. All these information is drawn directly via Apple Servers. If you have provided a jailbroken device to employees and children, things can be a bit confusing. At a point, installation requires physical access to the device, which isn’t desirable. Also, you are getting a reduced level of compatibility — as said earlier, iOS 6 to 8.4 and 9 to 9.1. From the installation point of view, things can be much tougher. On the other hand, jailbroken version of mSpy opens up a wide variety of surveillance options. Apart from all the basic spying options, you can monitor all types of IM clients, track GPS location and even get deleted chat logs. In addition to Internet Browsing History, you can know the bookmarks. mSpy also lets you remotely wipe data from target device. For those who don’t know, Jailbreaking can be a tough process for some people. Well, if you really want the mentioned features like GPS Location Tracking and complete IM Monitoring, you need to jailbreak your iOS device for better spying needs. Things are more or less the same in the case of Android. You need physical access to the device for installing mSpy on an Android phone. Also, if you need complete set of features — including Instant Message spying —, you have to root the target device. If these things are fine, you can move forward with mSpy. Now, we will check out the mSpy features offered for cell phone monitoring. Since there are a bigger number of features, we will divide them into sub-categories.            In most IMs, you have options to find the messages and media that have been shared. For instance, if we’d take the case of Telegram, you can even find the Secret/Hidden chats that the user has done. The best part is that you can even check the Snapchat messages, which are actually deleted. So, if your kids are sending some potentially-dangerous pictures or something, you can know that.   2. You can block certain applications, thus preventing the use. This is a great feature if your kids have installed something malicious or inappropriate. You should frequently take a look at the installed app list, though.  3. You can get alerted if mSpy gets uninstalled from the device. For instance, if mSpy gets blocked by an antivirus app, you will be notified about that.  4. In addition, mSpy offers comprehensive device reports. These reports are good if you haven’t been able to check the activities daily. At the end of the week or month, you can understand all the things that the targeted user has done. So, these are the noteworthy spying features you will find in mSpy for Phones. As said earlier, availability of these features depends upon the device/platform you are using. It also depends on whether the targeted phone is jailbroken/rooted. However, we believe, mSpy offers complete surveillance on the device. Check Out All features of mSpy here  mSpy has one of the simplest yet effective control panels in the world of smartphone monitoring programs. When we log into the account dashboard, there is not much of a mess. You can see the list of products that you have installed mSpy in. Everything else is arranged in the sidebar, for better access. From the drop-down menu on top, you can select one of the set-up devices. Once you have selected, many sections on the sidebar will be active. For instance, if you want to check out the Snapchat messages, you can simply click on the link named Snapchat and all the data will be visible in a few seconds or so. Altogether, I’d love to give a 5-star rating for the easiness of UI and the effective organization. The dashboard feels so simple to use, while providing every bit of information we need. Altogether, the dashboard can be a reason to recommend mSpy software to others. There are different kinds of support packages you get with every mSpy subscription. We will have a look on them for better understanding. If you haven’t purchased anything additional, you can get the standard support via emails only. There is a personalized support package, via telephone, which costs $12.99. if you can pay this 12.99, you can clear queries in a quicker way. On the other hand, if you need complete assistance and support, you can purchase mAssistance for $39.99. Personally speaking, I have used all the three types of support forms. Even in the free version, quality of the offered support is something commendable. The answers were quick and clear, and the emails are still a lot more useful. On the other hand, with mAssistance and Personalized Support, you can make things easier. In that case, you don’t have to worry about any glitch that may come across. You can simply call the toll-free support number and get things done. Considering all these points together, we’d say that mSpy is offering the best-in-town support for its products and services. No matter the plan you have purchased, the ticketing system and live call system — if you’ve paid for that — will be quite useful, at one point or another. There are two aspects of reliability in the case of mSpy. First, you should check the reliability of the company, whom you’re paying money. Second, you should see how much trustworthy mSpy is in terms of tracking and detectability. Talking about the company, mSpy has been in the industry for years, on the top position. You can easily trust the utility for all your surveillance needs on employees and children alike. It also supports a wide variety of payment methods, giving you the freedom to choose. If these are not enough to impress you, you should see the number of people who use mSpy and their impressions. Chances are, you would just go and purchase mSpy for your own needs. Obviously, we should also take into account the richer set of features. Altogether, we found mSpy to be completely reliable — as far as hassle-free smartphone monitoring is concerned. Coming to the second aspect, mSpy is absolutely undetectable. No matter what, the target is not going to find out that they’re being spied on. There are two major reasons for this assurance. First, mSpy icon won’t be visible on your app drawer or home screen. Nor will the user see some notification while the program is sending data. Second, in comparison, mSpy consumes a lower amount of battery and the reduction of battery percentage is quite negligible. Viewing things from these points, it’s clear that no one would detect the presence of mSpy on the target device. So, in short, you have more and more reasons to trust mSpy when it comes to purchasing. It’s a fool-proof method to spy on your children or employee without letting them know. Now, let’s have a look at the different plans offered by mSpy and their pricing. As the name says, this package lets you install mSpy on iPhone/iPad without jailbreaking the device. It too is priced at $69.99 for month. If you are ready to compromise the tracking features for not having to jailbreak the device, you can go with this package. As you can see, there is no change of pricing, but many features are still missing. Judging by the pricing and feature availability, we believe the pricing structure of mSpy is quite a lot impressive. It’s a great thing that you don’t have to pay for features you won’t use. We are impressed here.  So, in this mSpy Review, we have seen the different aspects of this spying solution. And, now, it’s the right time to take a decision about the whole service. It’s pretty much clear that mSpy offers a lot more features than many alternatives. Almost all features have been arranged through the dashboard, giving you instant access to it. Also, from the installation to initial set up, everything about mSpy is simple enough. You don’t need any professional support or technical guide to set up mSpy on the targeted device. Considering all these points alongside, the pricing is quite affordable as well. So, at the end of the day, I’d love to recommend mSpy for every conscious parent — or an employer who do not want leakage of data. It is surely worth the money and does the job it claims to. We also recommend to go for the advanced package, because you may need those features in future. By the way, how was your own experience with mSpy? Do let us know via comments.

        "body": "Sophos Home protects every Mac and PC in your home  Sorry, something happened and we could not sign you up. Please try again later. Check your inbox for our confirmation email. Sorry, we will not accept that email address. Please try a different address. We're adding your address to our list... We all know by now that the US’s National Stalker Agency – oh, excuse me, I meant to say National Security Agency (NSA) – eavesdrops on just about everybody on the planet. Evidently, the UK is no better. But surveillance by your own mother? Nothing is sacred. At any rate, that’s the takeaway you get after an eyeful of the mSpy application. mSpy is a mobile surveillance application that runs on smartphones and tablets including iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, Symbian, iPad and Galaxy Tab devices. Its marketing promises that users who install it on their phones can “remotely spy on text messages, call logs, and emails; track location, record surroundings, and more on smartphones and tablets.” Not only that, it stealthily keeps tabs on calendar information; records conversations; determines GPS coordinates of the phone and shows the location of the target device on a convenient map. Is that legal, you say? Hahahahahahahahahahahaha! What an adorable question. But yes. Yes, it is legal, as long as the “target” is a child or an employee and the surveillance operator has informed the “target”. From the company’s disclaimer: My Spy (mSpy) is designed for monitoring your children, employees or others on a smartphone or mobile device that you own or have proper consent to monitor. You are required to notify users of the device that they are being monitored. Its maker claims that the app is 100% undetectable by the device user, as a sale rep told The Next Web: After complete installation the application runs in a stealth mode, so it is undetectable and completely invisible for the target phone’s user. Physical access is required to install mSpy – which takes about 20 minutes – but not after that. Your mom, your dad, your boss, or any random, creepy friend or stalker who got his or her hands on your mobile phone can remotely tweak the application’s settings at any time with a convenient control panel on any internet-enabled device. If you find a shiny new gadget under the Christmas tree in December, you may well ponder whether your benefactor has slipped you an mSpy. Here’s what the company says about determining whether somebody’s installed mSpy on your gadget: It's impossible. Unlike other software of this kind, mSpy manages without SMS commands that appear in the message folder of the target mobile device to make the application work. The size of the activity data that gets uploaded to the server never exceeds 100kb and doesn't get noticed by the owner of the target phone when their phone bills arrive. Moreover, the mSpy application boasts a battle-tested history of insignificant battery power consumption so that the target device works as usual. Thus, it is virtually impossible for the owner of the target phone to detect the mSpy software as it can be controlled online without conspicuous connection between the server and the target phone. Are there legitimate reasons to conduct surveillance on people? Of course. Data leakage from corporations is one such. Employers who choose to do so should heed the company’s advice on the matter, though: Using the mSpy cell phone tracking software for spying on employees suspected of company theft, fraud or lying is absolutely legal. Companies also have a legal right to monitor phones used in the course of conducting company business to ensure the devices are not being misused. Companies are obliged to notify employees on what type of cell phone usage is deemed acceptable. Please note that by informing staff before installing mSpy on their phones, and by having them accept this as part of using the company-owned devices you will ensure that the company will not run into any legal problems. When it comes to monitoring employees, the buck doesn’t stop here with mSpy – it stops with the employer. Like mSpy advises, employers should make sure they inform employees regarding what’s considered to be appropriate mobile device use for their role. Informing staff that they’re being monitored is also a prudent thing to do. But what about monitoring children? Parents, do you already? If not, would you? If yes, then do your kids know they’re being monitored? I wouldn’t do that to anybody, and the NSA doesn’t share with the likes of me, so you’re just going to have to tell us your thoughts in the comments section below.

Follow @NakedSecurity on Instagram for exclusive pics, gifs, vids and LOLs! “It’s impossible” to detect? Challenge accepted.  lol  i assume your a beginner hacker looking into the attacking side of it.  Why would someone want to take the time to do this to someone? Why would they if you aren’t doing anything to them?  I’m not snooping on anyone. Would someone be snooping on me?  If you are “required to notify users of the device that they are being monitored”, then why should it be “undetectable by the device user”? If the user knows they’re being monitored, then there’s no point in hiding it from them. It’s almost as if they’re suggesting you can monitor people *without* their knowledge or consent, and only added the “please tell them” line to appease their lawyers.  I believe that the correct legal terminology for the recommendation that targets be notified prior to software installation is “let’s cover our ass.”  I believe that to be true  OK I’m late to the party here, but their is a use case for both legal monitoring and it being “undetectable” so long as it’s “undetectable” so it irremovable. However my guess is the company is trying to cater to… shall we say two markets…  The point is that your supposed to tell them that you’re going to be monitoring them, you just don’t have to tell them when.  Or even how.  This unfortunately creates a way for people to dishonestly invade the privacy of people even without let them know. Sadly deceptive and very dishonest practices and invasion of privacy of people’s lives is encouraged by these provisions. Doesn’t make it okay. If churches use this on their people is deceptive practice and the user should look themselves in the mirror and ask themselves how they’d feel to have their very privacy invaded so secretly….. horrifying when you think about it actually and a disrespect to people… For spousal use, creates a lack of safety and trust issue…. Those options create atmospheres that are Ill natured practices of control when you realize the outcome and use of the invasion of privacy.  Its mentioned from a legal company standpoint to cover their own end. Of course a parent or a partner is gonna possibly put the app on their child or lovers pbone and not tell them. And honestly thank God there is things like this to help people find out stuff they need to know.  Okay, you asked what I think of this, so here it is: BLECH. I hope not only Sophos but every other such system recognizes this atrocity as malware.  I doubt the legality of using this app in the UK to spy on another person. If the activity takes place in the UK, a person would be entitled to claim a breach of Article 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998, the right to respect for private and family life. Employers and others should be very wary of breaching the law in this respect.  I do not live in the UK but would the law apply if the employer owns the device being monitored and has an acceptable use policy in place?  Really, you have to notify your child that you are running the app on their phone that you pay for?  if its your phone – you have to notify yourself – if they want to borrow ‘your’ phone, they accept its liabilities.  Right! – I gotta say, I agree with the implied statement – my kids – my right to know. Don’t think so? If I’m letting them use my car, I’m liable for their irresponsibility. I bought the phone for them, I put it on before I give it to them. Period.  And if someone is on welfare you should be able to look into their private bank accounts and monitor/ control every penny they spend too? Would that then extend to the government, who is keeping track of the economy, monitoring how YOU spend/ save every penny in order to protect the (now struggling) economy (you’re a citizen in their country benefiting from their governing/ services, even just by living there so they may claim the right to do this eventually. They fix the roads, for instance which is a public tax paid service)? Just because you spend money on something doesn’t mean you can violate the rights of the person who received the money/ item/ service… There are huge privacy concerns here. you cannot violate other people’s basic rights under any circumstances… The minute people make excuses to violate one persons, it extends and expand to eventually include everyone. Those rights are there for a reason, and are being eroded on a massive scale now, all over the world. It is getting dangerous and ridiculous and I refuse to put up with it on my end.  I absolutely agree! People love to get on the band wagon about those receiving some kind of social security and are happy to see various human rights given away in exchange for getting that assistance. In reality however, everyone is making use of the tax-paid system – roading, education, etc. and indeed, in the process rights ARE given away. What education people’s kids are receiving, the content of the ‘messages’ they’re receiving – we Big Daddy government is paying, so Big Daddy says what gets taught. All sorts of compromises to basic human rights and freedoms are going on in the name of ‘protection’ and ‘for the greater good’. Bah! Wake up people, do you want to have your life run for you?  I totally agree, if my child is under 18 it is my business what they’re doing. Especially if I suspect they’re being dishonest or have been dishonest in the past. As a parent and for the safety of my child I definitely have the right to know whatever I want to know about my child. If they’re over 18 and don’t live at home I will give them their privacy. Bc we all have to have privacy. But do any of us have total privacy with anything. No not in this day and age and the insidious technology that’s terrorizing our world. But in some circumstances it can help or even save a life.  A couple of things… 1. I could not find anywhere on the mSpy website where it said that physical access to the phone was required (I might have missed it) but did find in the FAQs the implication that the ‘spyer’ could download it from their computer to someone’s phone. This isn’t good! 2. It’s a subscription service where all the data goes thru the mSpy servers. The subscription is a bit pricy at $40/month/phone for a basic home service. This would probably leave folks who want to play in the dust. 3. One of the ‘testimonials’ was from a woman who spied on her fiancé and found he was cheating on her. Do you suppose he gave her permission to install this on his phone? Bet not! Regardless – thanks for the article, it’s interesting. I’ll be sharing.  Name one government spy agency that does not collect data of any type on it’s citizens. I personally think it is fine to put this program on your child’s cell phone, as long as you let him/her know that it is monitored. Most kids won’t care as long as they have a cool phone + cool app(s) of the moment.  I don’t think they even have to be told especially if they’ve given reason not to be trusted but sware up and down that they haven’t been dishonest anymore but then learned they have but still insist theyve changed!! Spy away if ya ask me!!  I am an iOS software developer. I am very skeptical of mSpy’s claims of an app that can run, undetected, on a user’s iPhone and monitor their use of the device. Apple has built iOS so third party apps run in a “sandbox”, and don’t have access to the activities of other apps. They also don’t have the kernel-level access that would be required to monitor system activity. The only way I can think of that this would be possible is on jailbroken devices, and you can’t hide the fact that a device is jailbroken. Jailbreaking requires the knowledge and active cooperation of someone with the device’s password, and changes the way the device operates in very obvious ways. Rooting an Android device without the user’s knowledge might be possible. I’m less knowledgeable about that platform.  According to the article on The Next Web: “Thankfully, the app requires physical access for installation. The iOS version requires that the client device is jailbroken, and it isn’t currently compatible with iOS 7 and recent versions of iOS 6 (6.1.3 and 6.1.4).”  Thanks for your input. I would be interested to hear how this app might be detected by a layman who doesn’t have iOS development chops. Then again, I’d also be interested in hearing how it would be detected by somebody who *does* have iOS development skills. Might you expand on your comment?  1) If it’s an app, then how does it get installed on an iPhone without jailbreaking. 2) Within 48 hours of this article there will be an easy to use detection app, procedure or test that will be created by someone who despises this sort of thing. Wish it were me, but I don’t have the skill.  Who would like to install such a thing? Who knows it may be already installed and part of the OS 🙂 on our devices that ‘s why is not detectable By the way something that can monitor all your activity on the net is called ?  I think that using it as parental control is actually justified. Do you know any other phonesspy software? mSpy is a bit expensive I think.  It installs via a malicious link that is accessed via a web browser on the targeted device. Their “compatibility” page states that the target iOS device must be jailbroken. It also doesn’t currently work on iOS 6.1.4, 6.1.5 or 7.  Just found this article, so a late-for-you-but-not-for-me comment: I am really a bit confused about the statements trying to justify using such an app as employer or parent. At the end, IT security tries to make privacy possible. But if already some Sophos readers tend to give up privacy for the sake of questionably justified control, then where is the rest of world heading to? What for would an employer need total transparency about what an employee ever used his/her smartphone? If you don’t want loose confidential data, than better protect them at the source. Putting all this information onto mySpy’s server is probably the first step towards total leakage. Why on earth do you need to “spy on text messages, call logs, and emails; track location, record surroundings, …” for executing parental control? Would you want your parents do that to you? Your adult now? Do human rights depend on age? BTW: I do not believe the stealthy claim. Nevertheless, it is interesting how this obviously malicious may-be-property is good for marketing, just by sounding quite jamesbondish.  Human rights I agree to – Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happines. Several civil rights do have an age factor. I do not allow my child to smoke or drink, nor is she legally allowed to vote, drive, serve in the military, or sign contracts at the age of 12. As for rights on the device, it is understood in our family that the devices belong to us parents, and are not part of personal property. Her privacy is based on trust and understanding of where the limits are – in advance. When she is of an age to pay for and maintain her own phone (likely 16-18), it will her device and not mine. As for if she chooses to remain on my phone during such time, yes she will be reminded again of the apps one the device and the lack of familial privacy on the account. This is a communication device, not her personal diary.  Thank you for being a voice of reason! I am surprised at how many parents nowadays think children are mature, responsible, and wise enough to navigate the world with no supervision. It explains a lot about the state it is in now.  The mature responsible thing to do is to not give them a smartphone until they are mature and sensible enough to use one. Be that 12, 14, 16 or 18. Spying on their every move is as damaging as letting them do whatever they like. There needs to be a balance of trust and boundaries. Show your children no respect or trust and they won’t show you any back.  Installed it, never worked and they refuse to refund.  how do you remove it if you have it  How do u remove a spy app for android if it was downloaded without your permission. My phone was recently stolen last week’ came back magically and my sim card was gone and email was synchronized i noticed a red light on my android device that comes on and off as it pleases regardless of how full my battery is or if i have a notification..i have reset my phone but have great concern someone has downloaded a spy app that is hidden from my normal applications..how would i know and dismantle it’ if i didn’t give permission to a employeer and im over 18  If it’s your own phone you could trying doing a full reinstall of the firmware (which will wipe all your data), assuming your carrier has firmware images for download. If it’s your employer’s phone, you’ll need to let IT know that your phone was stolen and that you suspect the crook hacked the phone at the same time.  If I am in the United States and my bf is in the uk can he see my phone calls through the mobile spy app  How would you uninstall this if you feel someone has done this to stalk you?  Yes, my 11 year old daughter and I think her phone has this my spy wear installed on it, to control her and to keep tabs on me( his ex)! If someone knows how we can fool this app or help it be incorrect to the spy( dad). Please let us know! It’s a twisted way to try to control others . Trust is earned, being fearful is just plain scary and creepy.  Laura, I would assume if you erase the phone (bring it back to the original state) then every app, including this one will be erased. Just to make sure, I would change the password on the google account as well that way it could not be installed remotely.  Well, the worse possible abuse of this app has happened to my daughter who recently broke off her engagement to a police officer no less. Between breaking off the engagement and moving to Seattle he installed this app and has been tracking/stalking her every move. This app can and will be abused in endless ways by people who lack scruples, even people who have taken an oath to protect us.  I have a question if you do a factory reset would it be removed then?  I think it’s boss’s obligation to inform the employees of their being monitored. When I was told that my working phone is installed with iKeymonitor, I expressed my understanding even if I feel a little bit uncomfortable! If I found the fact by myself I’ll be very angry and I think I can prosecute my boss!  Great, install something like this on your phone. If a thief steals your phone, wait a while. Collect info on him, and exploit their bank accounts anonymously on the internet, or buy bitcoins with their money. Sounds like a great idea to me. I’m installing something similar today (not this though, this app is lame)  What’s the app you use?  I discovered in February of this year that who I thought was a family friend had actually been victimizing me for two years. Not only did he con money out of me, which took from the needs of my children and me, but he actually told me that a ‘friend’ of his had installed a camera on my phone and was watching everything I did around my home. He listened in on private phone calls, and viewed private texts of myself and others. This is CRIMINAL behavior and he will be prosecuted for it.  Perhaps is it detectable by noticing no internet connection during your phone conversation and then once internet is accessible your call is dropped?  Have just been tracked / monitored for a significant period of time by my now former partner using a zoemob application as well as recording devices around the home we shared The app gave my partner information that i may not with Her to know and she would often use this in a negative or controlling way The psychological impact on myself was substancial leading to psyco therapy and a breakdown as it lead to arguments that were irrealvent and at times unecessary The Apps are in fact a very dangerous tol especially in the wrong hand something gauranteed to deastate a relationship The police in general unaware of the laws that the apps violate and the effects on the target person the accumlative effects of long term privacy invasions are devastating Should be banded and the preprtrator prosacuted The app is was able t  How do you seure a prosacution if you are unaware that the app is installed and monitoring your every moved and conversations i recently found an app on my hand set but the reaction from the police was that my partner was paranoid and thought i was a serial bed hopper with such reaction how can the victim of a faceless crime seek justice the information my partner gained from the app gave her power and the knowledge to control and abuse every privat text was read and even the langauge used would be questioned the apps arclosely linked with domestic abuse and give abusers the ultimate power has anyone else had a experience of being abused in this way  So what happens to the person spying if the target is not informed?  is this a joke story the only way for to spy is someone put it on your phone behind your back…  what if someone is looking at you at all times and harassing you have a app on your apartment , in your car and at work even when you go shopping and is talking to you all day and all night and it’s only where you can hear it. what can be done because if they are looking in your apartment how can you change password and they have a mic so they are close by your place because I can hear them talking  Every time I’m using messenger when a certain person calls me there’s an online dot that appears by the camera and my camera looks like it’s activating could he be spying on me? And if yes how do I get it off my phone?  Comment  Name  Email  Website    Δdocument.getElementById( \"ak_js\" ).setAttribute( \"value\", ( new Date() ).getTime() );"

        "desc": "This review of mSpy has been around for several years now and has changed many times. I update it monthly and when there are any major changes to the program. This is important when looking at any mSpy reviews online - you need to be up to date with the latest changes.",
        "body": "Time for my review of mSpy monitoring software – is it reliable, does mSpy work, what can it do and why is it the most popular spy app today? Not just another one of the many standard mSpy reviews, this one is real and in depth! I’m going to show you a few unique features of this spy app – reasons to consider this one over the rest! I’ll give you a quick version review – if you are in a hurry – and then go into much more detail to help you make an informed choice. If you follow this website, you are already aware that before writing a review of any spy software, I test it personally for a period of time so I can get a really good insight into its characteristics. This time around, I was testing out MSpy, one of the most popular cell phone spy software programs. This review contains my real-life experience using this software, and it should provide you with some sound advice – if this is the spy software for you!   Table of Contents This program has been selling and developing since 2011 – not exactly new players so you have the benefit of continuing support and a good track record. Big changes in the spy phone market – have led to a great boost in popularity for MSpy. They have a proven track record offering high quality cellphone and tablet spy / monitoring apps – their software just works! More than can be said for many of their so called competitors. It has grown into a true market leader – with over 1 million users worldwide making them the best selling spy program right now. Their main competition at the top end is Flexispy, they offer many similar functions but there are differences worth noting – not least in pricing, where M-Spy is slightly ahead. There is a good reason why mSpy is top of my very small list of recommended spy apps! There are very limited cons to this service.  In my reviews, I try do more than just give you a repeat of their website, listing the features one by one. They do a good enough job with that ! I’m going to focus more on the unique, advanced features and the reliability of the program, to help you make an educated decision when selecting the best spy phone software for your needs – a unique and real mSpy review! You can select one of two main packages: Basic and mSpy Premium. Their Basic program comes with a wide range of features including all of the regular features you’d expect such as voice call logging, texts reporting, GPRS tracking and browser history. For most of the more advanced features you will need to go for their Premium program. Below is the latest mSpy 2020 Price List: They also have a Family Package – it allows you to monitor up to 3 devices and saves 20% : The one month package is good if you want to test out the software or just use it for a short time. On the other hand, long-term packages offer better value for money. If you go for the 12 month deal it will cost the equivilent of $16.66 per month for the Premium package.    This spy app has been developed for use on most modern mobile devices. It started out as just mobile phone monitoring software but with the rise of tablets and many different models of cell phones, it had to extend compatibility. They are now covering Android Tablets and Apple devices such as the iPad and iPad Touch. Most mobile devices are covered as long as they are internet enabled. You simply need to know the operating system that is installed on the target device (the phone you need to monitor) and match it to the m Spy version you buy. Here is a quick reference guide to their current supported Operating System versions: You should always check the website for latest updates and the latest version information – they even have a useful list of cell phones and devices currently supported – by make and model making things easy for you. Make sure you also double check that the features you really need are covered by the version that matches the target device – the Android features list is slightly different to Apple devices – always check! They also have a No Jailbreak Version of the software again with different features – I go into the details below, so keep reading! Now, let’s get onto the good stuff. Needless to say, they cover all of the standard monitoring requirements: logging voice calls, sms text messages, emails, plus internet browser history reporting and accurate GPS tracking. These are pretty standard for all programs these days. I’m going to show you some of the features which set it apart from other monitoring apps. This feature is highly valued by employers and of course parents. It basically allows you to set up certain “restricted” areas using Google Maps – you can easily set the boundaries. If the GPRS tracking shows the phone or device leaving (or entering) that zone – you will get an alert. The alerts can be set to send you an email or just to show up as a breach in the online dashboard. You can also view the logs showing the phone movements during any time period. It is really user friendly and easy to set up. Their tracking and alerts system works well and is one of their biggest selling points for parents and employers. They have worked hard to provide monitoring of a comprehensive list of Chat / Messenger and Social sites. These services are extremely popular especially with younger users and no monitoring solution would be complete without some coverage. They keep adding to the list – right now they can spy on: SnapChat, WhatsApp,Viber, Skype, Line, Telegram, iMessage (iPhone and iPad only) plus Facebook Messenger, Instagram and Twitter. Again, check compatibility for the services you need to cover. Tinder spy features have just been added to the mix – allowing you to monitor all Tinder activity. Remember this is extremely powerful – you can see message contents and even media such as pictures and videos – sent and received using these platforms. If you are monitoring kids – you need this! M-Spy are one of the ONLY ones at the moment to monitor SnapChat and Now Tinder! You can set up a list of phone numbers from which you don’t want to receive incoming calls. Great for parents aiming to limit contact with undesirable friends! You can have great control over the target phone using this feature and it works really well. Allows you to block any access to a list of websites – you can choose any. You can block them totally or allow them during specified time slots. Again this feature is very useful for parental control and for employee monitoring – are your staff wasting Your time browsing online and checking Facebook, when they are supposed to be working? This feature can actually save you money and increase productivity. Just a thought! You can choose which apps to block on the target phone – cut out their use completely rather than just monitoring activity and messages. You can even use this to block the internet altogether for example. Remember the days when phones were just phones? Need to keep your kids off YouTube? This is an original feature – it logs every Key Stroke on the device. This lets you see everything that has been typed on the monitored device – from emails and texts to web addresses and even passwords with their login details. This is an outstanding feature but it is only available on Android devices at the moment – and it works really well. I like this one as it has many uses! This will allow you to see when the device has accessed any Wi-Fi networks – enabling you to track the phone even if the GPRS is switched off. It shows a list with times and details of any connections made. You can also remotely restrict access to public Wi-Fi hotspots. Wi-Fi use on business devices can pose a threat to company information – and personally, things like bank details, logins and passwords can all be hacked through public Wi-Fi access. They have several features that help to make managing the target device really easy. One feature allows you to fine-tune the way you receive reports. For example, you can have reports accessed Only via the web Dashboard interface – or have them uploaded only when the device has a Wi-Fi connection, any connection or none – to pause reporting. This allows greater control and it circumvents using the target devices own data plan for uploading the logs and reports. This isn’t usually a problem as the data packets are small and rarely noticeable – but if you are viewing lots of images or video, it can use more data. You can further control reporting and how it is managed – by setting the time intervals that reports are generated and sent to the dashboard. Sometimes you need up to the minute reporting and at other times a couple of times a day will be enough – it depends on your needs. You can also update the Spy program automatically – with no need to access the phone again after the initial installation. You can do things like phone locking, data wiping, SIM change notification – app control, such as starting, pausing or deleting, all through the online control panel. The interface is clearly laid out and really easy to use. Think about some of these features and how You could use them – features like these are why I can recommend mspy software to anyone. People sometimes focus on recording voice calls and other fancy features but ones like these really give you control. This is a really strong point with this product. Reports can be personalized to a high degree – so that you see what matters to you the most. You can customize reports and their frequency – best of all it is very intuitive and easy to set up – you can also download the data reports in several different formats. This unique reporting and data management is a perfect tool for small business users who monitor more than one phone. I mentioned this new development above. Now you can choose this service as different way to spy on an iPhone without Jailbreaking it first. (It works for all compatible Apple devices including iPads and iPod Touch etc.) Don’t confuse this with their regular spy software – it works in a completely different way and offers fairly limited monitoring features. Jailbreaking is not required because No actual software program is downloaded or installed on to the target phone / device! It works by accessing the device backups in the free iCloud backups account and reporting the changes at intervals. To use this version you must have the user’s Apple ID and their password – and the device must be set up to use automatic backups in iCloud (Apple’s free cloud backup solution). It is easy to setup the iPhone backups if this has not already been done by the user. This system is not ideal in some situations as it requires their Apple ID and Password but can be useful if Jailbreaking is not an option. It is completely stealthy when set up properly – no notifications will be sent to the iCloud backup center. To get started – simply sign in with the users details and you can view reports online – not quite in real time as it depends on how often backups are set to update but you can change these settings in the iCloud interface. Remember – there is no software to install on the phone / device. M Spy will access the backups via the iCloud account online and reports will be displayed in your Online Dashboard area. Reporting is also limited when compared to their standard spy software. With the No Jailbreak version you can still see : detailed call logs with numbers and time stamps, text messages including contents, location history, full web browser history with sites visited, notes, contacts, events and it lists installed apps. Messenger and social monitoring is limited but you can still monitor : Skype, WhatsApp, Line and view Facebook activity in the browser reports. All in all it can be a good solution when, for some reason, Jailbreaking an Apple device is not possible. It offers a limited form of monitoring and is not to be mixed up with their full featured spy software program. Still a very useful program for many people but if you can Jailbreak – the full software is much more powerful and versatile. As part of this mspy review – I like to look at some things that make it stand out from the rest, a reason to help you make decisions. Great Support – they offer a Premium support package which you can purchase for $29.95 – perhaps an option for beginners or if you have problems with installation. This is not mandatory and I haven’t used it myself, so I can’t vouch for the quality. For that payment they will help you with Rooting Android or Jailbreaking the iPhone and then take you through the main software install. A little extra help if you think you need it! Their official website is also worth mentioning. The interface is very clean and streamlined, and unlike most similar websites, the main buying page makes it very clear what features you are getting for the money you are paying.  Also, they offer a money back guarantee in case you are not satisfied with their product. Unlike some less reputable companies, they actually honor it! Apart from live chat and email support, it is refreshing to know that they offer telephone support as well. It is comforting to know you can talk to an actual person in case you run into a problem. They also have a live demo , which lets you know how the features and reports really work. This is great if you are new to this kind of program – check it out. Sold by MTechnology Ltd, which has offices in both the UK and the US, they have built up a good reputation in the business. The company puts a lot of effort in developing good customer support, and it shows, though their ten-day money back guarantee, telephone support and secure payment methods by credit and debit cards and PayPal. This software app has been selling very well for several years and I think we can safely say that it is a reliable option and one that you can rely on in the long run. There is no mSpy Scam! As for the final verdict, it’s up to you. You need to decide on what it is that you are looking for in a spy app. Take into account all the features and options offered, as well as the price. If you need reliable monitoring with a good range of management features – they are hard to beat. Only FlexiSpy can offer more in terms of advanced monitoring such as call recording etc.   Personally, I like this Spy software – it has a lot going for it, not just the features and support, but also a great website and a well-designed control panel. I hope my real mSpy review has shed some light on the details and I also hope you find it useful when choosing the right spy software for your own needs. This review of mSpy has been around for several years now and has changed many times. I update it monthly and when there are any major changes to the program. This is important when looking at any mSpy reviews online – you need to be up to date with the latest changes. Over the years I have received many comments and questions about the mSpy app – you can check the comments below for questions from genuine users. To make things easy for you I have put together a list of mSpy FAQ – quick and easy answers to your questions. If there is anything you are not sure about and it hasn’t been answered already – feel free to leave a comment below and I will do my best to answer you. Yes it is very well hidden – something they have worked at over the years. It is one of the most difficult spy apps to detect and will not be discovered easily. Yes some sort of internet connection is required to upload the data to the reporting dashboard. All spy apps have this requirement. It will work with Wi-Fi or a data plan. Yes as long as there is an internet connection. The site is also available in a range of languages. No – there is no mention of mspy it will refer to the payment processor discreetly. No but you will see your renewal date in the dashboard reporting area and can renew at any time. It works for Android devices and Apple iPhone, iPad etc.  Yes they were the first to come out with this solution and still lead the way. Very important today as the latest Apple devices cannot be Jailbroken. Rooting Android is not absolutely necessary but some features will not work such as monitoring social messenger apps like Snapchat etc. To get the most out of the app I would recommend Rooting if at all possible. It is one phone per license – but you could buy more licenses and monitor them from one online dashboard. You can also transfer your license to another phone at any time. No – FlexiSPY is the only reliable spy app that can record and listen to live voice calls – only available with their most expensive package. No – as with all spy software apps you need physical access to install the software. The only exception is with the no jailbreak version for the iPhone – no software is installed on the target device as it monitors the iCloud backup changes. This means it can be possible to use this version without having the target device. Yes it can be removed remotely from the online reporting dashboard. You will not need access to the target phone again. For the regular software install versions you can chose the reporting interval at setup. For the no jailbreak version it will update according to the backup frequency – usually 12 or 24 hours. Once the app is installed you will see all texts sent and received – even if they are deleted immediately. But it will not recover old deleted texts from before your mSpy installation. Yes they call it mAssistance and you can purchase it at checkout. They will help you Root or Jailbreak the device and then install the software and get it set up. You will need to connect the phone to a PC or laptop and use remote assistance. Great service for those worried about the tech side of using mSpy.  No you can view from any internet enabled device such as your own phone or tablet. Very unlikely – they work hard to make sure the files are hidden and do not flag any antivirus scans. Yes there is a keylogger feature which will allow you to see logins and passwords for apps such a Facebook etc. Anything typed using the phone keypad will be recorded. Another important spy feature. Yes – apart from mAssistance you get full email and live chat support. One of the best support services available for a spy app. Phone support is available for an extra fee. They don’t have a free trial but have a working demo on their site. You can take a short term license to try it out before committing to the yearly packages (which are much better value). They also have a money back guarantee. That’s it for now on the Q and A section – anything I haven’t covered feel free to get in touch using the comment section below. For mSpy’s own FAQ page you can look here too. Thanks for reading and good luck! I'm Michael and I've been running this site since 2011. I'm a real person and not some big company pushing their own products! Right from the start I realised that spy apps can be used legally and ethically to help parents keep their kids safe …. so I started this site. Michael Keenan SpyzRus.com Comments are closed. "

The online control panel gives remote access and enables you to send SMS commands to the target device for a specific action. But you need the Apple ID to monitor an iPhone. Live demo is unavailable on the official website. However, it offers a free trial download. Spyier comes in pricing plans of Standard, Premium, and GOLD. It is mainly a solution for Android devices. It is likely that all advertised features are not available in the Spyier iOS monitoring software. Another best iPhone spy software is Minspy. It is a cross-platform software solution that is compatible with Android, Windows, and Mac too. Minspy App comes with a plethora of monitoring features. The biggest disadvantage of Minspy is the need to install it in the iOS device. To install the Minspy, you need to jailbreak the device. Even the basic features are not available without jailbreaking. Minspy runs discreetly and hides the Cydia icon too. Once the device is jailbroken, you get access to over 200 features. You can use several options developed for parental control purposes. See keystrokes, listen to call recordings, activate the camera to see phone surroundings, send spoof SMS and send remote commands to dictate the activity on the target device. Minspy is an expensive purchase. You can consider buying Minspy only if you have extensive monitoring needs and want to switch between different platforms. A wise choice is to go for a safer tracking app such as Spy which provides you reasonable monitoring features without tampering the device’s warranty. Remember that you don’t need physical access of target iPhone for setting up Spyic which gives Spyic another Competitive edge over Minspy. Spyine is an innovative technology-based system. It is used to spy on SMS of the target number. It works differently as compared to other tools in this list. Spyine needs your country name, mobile number and your email address to retrieve the SMS messages. It gets the latest 50 incoming and 50 outgoing messages. To view the messages, you need to solve a survey of your interest. Then, a file is downloaded to get the activation code. Using that code, you can read the intercepted messages. As compared to other spy applications, the functionality of Spyine is much restricted. It can only spy on most recent 100 SMS only. This means you don’t get access to one complete conversation if it’s lengthy. It also requires users to get an Apple ID.  Another best spyware for iPhone iPad is Spyzie. It provides a lot of features to monitor the target device. The best thing about Spyzie is its compatibility with a variety of devices. Spyzie comes with a No Jailbreak Solution for the iOS devices. You need to enter the iTunes credentials to set it up on the target devices. When done, you can monitor calls, SMS, location, instant chat messengers and several other activities. A live demo is available for the user to review its features. The UI is quite neat, clean and pleasant on eyes. Spyzie has overall good customer support. The customer support team can be reached and informed of any problems. Appmia is a spy software package for iPhone monitoring designed to spy on iPhone activities regardless of which model is used. It runs in the stealth mode and gives you access to all information on the target device. It comes at an affordable price of as low as $16 per month. It offers the standard iOS monitoring features of tracking calls, SMS, instant messages, emails, calendar activities, and address book. You can also track the location of the monitored device. There are extra features that let you view installed applications and access media files. Appmia offers advanced features of remotely controlling the target device. Listen to the phone surroundings and record calls. You can restrict some contacts, messages, and keywords. Moreover, you can block websites and social networks from being accessed on the monitored device. Now, let’s talk about the user experience of Appmia. A live demo of the spy software is available for you to experience the functionalities before making a purchase. The menu is self-explaining and there is no problem for the user to find an option. Unlike Spyic, the design of the software is technical and it gives an uncomfortable feeling. Similarly, Appmia needs the device to root and jail, which reduces its stance against its ‘No Root No Jailbreak Spyic’ counterpart. GuestSpy is a popular and user-friendly iPhone monitoring app. It is used for watching over your kids and monitoring of your employees. GuestSpy tracks all activities including phone calls, GPS tracker, calendar updates, text messages, emails, web history, internet history, and instant messages. It gives you remote control over the target device so that you can send remote commands and restrict the device’s activity. Live demo is not available for the potential buyers. However, you can start monitoring with a free trial. Note that GuestSpy, unlike Spyic, works on jailbroken devices only – a factor that may disqualify GuestSpy from your purchase options. Teensafe is the cheapest option to spy on an iPhone. Teensafe comes with a lifetime license for a cost of $9.99 only. It provides all basic monitoring features. Besides, it claims to provide advanced features of GPS tracker or sending remote commands and stealth cameras to capture the surroundings. Teensafe comes at the end of our list because it does not provide any live demonstration of the working software. Unlike Spyic and Cocospy, physical access to the target iPhone is needed to install the Teensafe. Another worrisome factor that you must consider before buying is the feedback of Teensafe users. Several users have claimed that Teensafe does not provide the advertised features. Click here to know more about Teensafe>> SpyBubble is a cell phone monitoring solution for iPhone and Android devices. It claims to provide all monitoring features at a minimal price. The user interface is quite basic and a sore in the eyes. Note that we are not recommending you to go for SpyBubble. Yet, it is important to discuss it so that you don’t fall into the scam. Yes, SpyBubble is a scam application. Many customers have reported that they were never able to install the application. Some users have requested for refund but the company uses stalling techniques to avoid issuing a refund. There is no customer support page or contact option on the official website. When installed, several features do not work at all so you would not be able to spy completely on the target device. The battery drains out quickly which gives the person a hint about its presence. Also, the person being monitored receives an update notification revealing a supposedly secret act. With so many working iPhone spying solutions, making the right decision can be hard. In order to decide on the right no-jailbreak iPhone spy software, you should keep the following factors in mind: Ease of Use: Unless you have the patience and skills of a pro hacker, it is important to choose an app that is easy to use. This prevents you from facing issues every other minute and having to search for ‘how-to’ guides in order to figure out how to make it work. Stealth: Due to the nature of the process, secrecy is an important component to evaluate. You don’t really want to get caught spying on someone’s phone, do you? Therefore, the iPhone spy app should place focus on being able to get you the iPhone data without the iPhone owner knowing about it. Data Security: Many users hesitate from using an iPhone spy app since they believe that there are risks of data breach. Therefore, it is advisable to use an app that prioritizes security over everything else.  Price: Price is an important factor for people who do not have wads of cash lying around in their pockets. While there is no such thing as a free iPhone spy app that actually works, you can get apps like Spyic and Cocospy for considerably low subscription plans. Features: An iPhone spy app is no good if it cannot do what you want it to do. Therefore, before signing up for an iPhone spy app, check out if its features fulfil the requirements you have in mind. Based on all these factors, you can go ahead with any app in the top half of this list as they satisfy the criteria. Spyic, in particular, tends to ace every factor listed above. While many apps don’t allow the facility to spy on an iPhone without touching it, top notch apps such as Spyic can make it happen. If you want to spy on an iPhone remotely, you will need to verify its iCloud credentials with the spying app. It depends on the app that you use. Most apps require you to jailbreak the target iPhone. However, if you use the best apps out there, jailbreaking the iPhone isn’t needed. No, there is no 100% free way to spy on an iPhone. Some iPhone spy apps claim to be free. However, when you try using them, they just waste your time and never work. No, the best iPhone spy apps out there can work even from a whole different corner of the world. Now you know about the best iPhone spy app, I am sure some of your worries are already lessened. You can go ahead and try out the app that you feel is going to be right for you. No matter which app you choose on the list, you won’t be disappointed.

Man has continued to … Does it allow you in the Browser History to see the incognito history?﻿ Hi Kimberly. mSpy for computers is capable of monitoring browser history and bookmarks in most popular browsers Chrome, Firefox, IE, Edge and Safari including “incognito” and “private” modes. My son detected the app and was able to uninstall it. As I am in great fear of his drug abuse, I am really disappointed that this app worked for less than a week before it got detected. I wonder how this could have happened and if there is a way to reinstall the app without being found again. Is there any keylogger that is undetectable by the owner? Thank you. Hi Bobbie. Right now FlexiSpy and iKeyMonitor are the ones with stealth mode options. Please read my review on them for more info. So since you say the icon is visible on the phone, my employee willl know the application is installed on their device? Is there a way to make it so that no icon shows in the device?

How often does mSpy information gets updated? If you are using mSpy Without Jailbreak, you receive information within 24 hour since the latest back up has been done. Usually it takes that much time because backups can reach up to few gigabytes and it depends on WiFi connection quality.

The Update Interval specifies how often mSpy is connected to our server and transfers information directly to your Control Panel.

Once fully installed, mSpy will begin sending monitored data logs to your personal Control panel. Hi Franklin. Can I track two or more devices with one license? Hello Lauren. With a Basic or Premium mSpy subscription, you can track only one device. However, you can change the monitored device as many times as you want without any additional fees by uninstalling from one device and installing the application on another. To be able to track multiple devices, purchase a separate mSpy subscription for each device. If you need to monitor 5 devices in one account, I recommend getting the Business subscription. You can save up to 20% if you’ll do that. Okay, thanks for the info. If I purchased mSpy, will it reflect on my bank or credit card statement? Yes, your mSpy purchase will appear on your bank or credit card statement as AVANGATE*MSECURITY Pingback: mSpy Review | Vincent Roa Group LLC - Business ...

Once installed in the targeted devices, mSpy icon cannot be found on the app drawer or list. 2. Even better, the app and service are not listed on the App Manager. This is pretty cool, because, even if the target thinks he/she is being tracked, there is no way to confirm it. Another possible way the target can find tracking software is through the presence of battery draining. Quite thankfully though, mSpy consumes a minimal amount of energy for tracking. So, chances are, your targets — be it your children, partner or employee — will never find the presence of mSpy in device. The case is more or less the same in case of computers. We did not find the mSpy in any part of PC and Mac; nor did we spot them in Activity Manager and Task Manager In other words, we can say that mSpy is practically undetectable. We believe this is so important when you’d purchase a smartphone tracking package for serious needs. It is the best app for anyone who feels the need to monitor their loved and dear ones and that of the employees. Keeping the economic measures and competent features in mind, This app is appropriately designed for monitoring purposes. The contemporary report managing features with few unique extra spaces like Keylogger and Premium support is what makes it an impeccable deal to choose for yourself. I acknowledge the well constructed and efficient product which will definitely suit your requirements with its extended features. The mSpy review for iPhone and Android must have given you the enough insight to select a good quality monitoring software. Using this spyware is one of the best options to monitor the other person’s activities through their cell phone. So Get Started Now!

This is legit? 3) Regarding the non-jailbreak version what I need : call history and deleted calls, text messages and (especially) deleted messages / partially deleted messages, contact lists. I’d love voicemail..which I don’t recall being addressed here. Thanks Hello AJ, I am glad that you liked my review of mSpy. Here are the answers to your questions. 1. Once the mSpy gets installed on your daughters iPhone you can view each text message sent or received by your daughters phone. Even the deleted one’s. 2.

I am currently separated from my spouse. Last night while I was setting up a Twitter account, my estranged spouse followed the account. It was only within a few minutes of me opening the account and, as I stated, he followed during set up. I haven’t even sent a tweet out from the account yet. I’m assuming he has installed spay ware on my phone but I don’t know how he could as he doesn’t know my lock code to get into my phone or my iCloud id and password. Do you know of any spyware that he could use to access my phone without having any of my passwords? Thank you! Josie, there is no such spyware that can be installed on the target cell phone without having access to it. So you don’t have to be worried about the spy software on your cell phone. There might be a second case in which if you have setup the twitter account on your laptop/desktop and your spouse has installed a keylogger on that then there is a possibility that your spouse can use your twitter account. Hope that helps. is it possible to retrieve snapchats photoes, videos and chats retoactively? Yes it is possible to retrieve Snapchat photos, videos and chats retroactively.
