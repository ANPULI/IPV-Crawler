        "body": "Links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. Here it is ladies and gentlemen. The crème de la crème. The Android apps that stand alone at the top of the pantheon. These apps have become ubiquitous with Android and if you’re looking for good stuff it’s assumed that you have some of this stuff already. There are a ton of amazing Android apps out there. However, there are a few that stand out above the rest. These apps are useful to just about everyone no matter what their use case may be. Without further delay, here are the best Android apps currently available. Most people should be relatively familiar with most of these apps. They are the best, and the best things are rarely anonymous. It’s difficult to get into the hall of fame, but we do have the best lists attached to each selection in case you want to see more options. Price: Free / $1.99 1Weather is arguably the best weather app out there. It features a simple, paginated design that shows you the current weather, forecast for up to 12 weeks, a radar, and other fun stats. Along with that, you’ll get a fairly decent set of lightly customizable widgets and the standard stuff like severe weather notifications and a radar so you can see the storms approaching. Perhaps its best feature is its minimal design which just shows you the weather and little else. The UI is easy to move around and the weather fun facts are a cherry on top. The free version has all of the features with advertising. The $1.99 charge removes advertising. Otherwise, the two versions work the same way. Most will also likely enjoy the range of weather fun facts as well when you open the app. We have a list of the best weather apps and widgets if you want more options. Price: Free / $1.99-$299.99 per month  Price: Free  Price: Free  Price: Free / $12 per year LastPass is one of those must-have Android apps. It’s a password manager that lets you save your login credentials in a safe, secure way. On top of that, it can help generate nearly impossible passwords for you to use on your accounts. It’s all controlled with a master password. It has cross-platform support (premium version only) so you can use it on computers, mobile devices, tablets, or whatever. There are others, but LastPass always feels like it’s one step ahead. Additionally, the premium version is cheap. You can also grab LastPass Authenticator to go along with it for added security. There are other options for great password managers here and some free LastPass alternatives if the new, more restricted free version isn’t doing it for you. LastPass also has an authenticator app for additional security. Read more: Price: Free Microsoft SwiftKey Keyboard is one of the most powerful and customizable third-party keyboards available. It hit the market several years ago with a predictive engine unlike anything any other keyboard had and the app has grown a lot of over the years. It’s a free download and you can purchase themes for it if you want to. Other features include a dedicated number row, SwiftKey Flow which allows for gesture typing, multiple language support, cross-device syncing of your library, and much more. It’s about as good as it gets in the keyboard space. It’s true that Microsoft now owns SwiftKey, but so far they have managed not to mess it up. Gboard, Google’s keyboard app, is also exceptionally good and we honestly could’ve listed either one. There are some other great Android keyboards here as well. Price: Free / $4.99  Price: Free / $3.99  Price: Free trial / $4.99  Price: Free trial / $2.99 File browsing is something everyone inevitably has (or wants) to do, so you might as well do it with a capable, fantastic file browser. Solid Explorer is pretty much as good as it gets in the file explorer apps realm. It features Material Design, archiving support, support for the most popular cloud services, and even some more power user stuff like FTP, SFPT, WebDav, and SMB/CIFS support. It looks great, it’s incredibly stable, and it just works well. There is a 14-day free trial with a $2.99 price tag at the end of it. There are other file browsers with more features, but few blend together looks, ease of use, and features like Solid Explorer does. If this doesn’t work for you, here are some other outstanding file browsers. Check out some excellent hardware as well: Price: $2.99 and Free, respectively Tasker is a glorious application if you have the patience to learn how to use the app. What it does is allow users to create custom made commands and then use them in various places. There are many apps out there that have Tasker support and you can even use Tasker to create very complex commands for NFC tags. It’s difficult to truly explain what this app can do because it can do so many things. Between the apps supported, plugins you an add, and the sheer volume of stuff that you can do, there aren’t many apps out there as useful as this one. IFTTT is another excellent automation app. In some cases, it may even be better than Tasker thanks to its simplicity and wide range of uses. Tasker is also available free as part of the Google Play Pass. There are some other great Android tools and utility apps, but none of them can step up to Tasker and IFTTT. Price: Free / $4.49  Price: Free / $27.99 per year  Price: Free / $12.99+  Price: Free / $0.99 per month / $4.99 per year Last, but certainly not least on our list is Zedge. This is a wallpaper, ringtones, notification tones, and alarm tones app that gives you an unbelievable number of options to customize the most basic parts of your device. On top of having an exhaustive collection of things, Zedge also promotes various items during holiday seasons making it easy to theme your phone up for Christmas, Halloween, and other holidays. It’s not 100% perfect. It does have the occasional bug and some truly irritating advertisements. Zedge Premium is a new initiative to provide premium content at a reasonable price. You watch ads or fill out surveys to earn Zedge credits as well. There are othergreat ringtone apps and great wallpaper apps. However, Zedge is the only one that reliably does both. ExpressVPN is one of the most trusted, secure brands in the virtual private network industry, and that’s for good reason. It’s super fast and extremely safe, boasting an SSL-secured network with 256-bit encryption and, get this, unlimited bandwidth and speed. ExpressVPN has servers in 94 countries (including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, and others) in over 145 locations around the world, so there will always be a location near you to give you the best experience possible. What’s more, the service even has stealth servers in Hong Kong. They are to evade the GFW specifically. It doesn’t even look like you’re using a VPN!

        "body": "The Google Play store has millions of apps. Some are terrific, some are duds. Our guide, which covers 13 key categories and 103 top apps, features the ones that deserve a place on your Android phone or tablet. Android tablets and phones are technological marvels that entertain, let you work from any location, and keep you connected with friends, family, and coworkers. With the right app, you can transform your humble cell or slate into a mobile movie theater, work station, art canvas, recipe manager, and so much more. Unfortunately, finding the best Android apps is a bit of a challenge. There's a titanic quantity of apps to download from the Google Play Store, but which ones are worth their salt? We’ve assembled this list to help you discover worthwhile apps, so read on: You may find something you didn’t even know you needed. These 103 recommended apps are organized into 13 categories, including music, productivity, security, and utilities, so it's easy to find ones that suit your mood. Need an entertaining streaming video service? There's an app for that. In search of a dependable word processor that'll keep you productive while on the go? There's an app for that, too. Note that we don't include any games in this roundup. For those, check out our separate list of the best Android games. If this is your first time with an Android device, 103 apps might be overwhelming. If so, take a look at our list of 10 must-have Android apps to cover the basics. If your wallet is feeling a little light, know that many of the entries in both lists are free. Each recommended app is excellent in its own way. Taken together, our collection is a snapshot of the Google Play Store's best apps at the time of writing. So explore and enjoy. We didn't forget about iPhone and iPad users. For the iOS faithful, check out our roundups of the best iPhone apps and the best iPad apps. Brave Privacy Browser offers many features aimed at protecting your security and privacy on the web. For instance, it includes built-in blockers for ads, pop-ups, scripts, and third-party cookies. It even implements the HTTPS Everywhere extension, so you can ensure that your connections to sites are secure. The lightweight, minimal design looks great, too. Based on Google’s Chromium codebase, DuckDuckGo is a minimalistic browser designed to keep your online activities private. DuckDuckGo defaults to the highest encryption available for whatever site you visit, and lets you wipe your browsing history with a button tap. If you’re tired of trackers hounding you for advertisement purposes, and want to browse the web with a bit of freedom, give DuckDuckGo a download. Firefox is lickety-split fast, and has a clean design that is a joy to use. Mozilla makes a big point about how it doesn't collect your data, and we are pleased to see that the app comes with a full complement of security settings—including an option to protect your information from advertisers and a private browsing mode. Like the desktop version, Firefox for mobile has a robust plug-in selection, excellent tab management, and a dynamic start page for bookmarks and the latest headlines. You can even sync settings, history, and tabs with the desktop variant Microsoft Edge lets you easily sync web pages, bookmarks, and browsing history between your Android device and the Edge browser on your desktop. Top features of the mobile browser include an integrated reading view, news ratings (handled by NewsGuard), and a content blocker (powered by Adblock Plus). You can search with Bing using your voice or by selecting a photo, as well as earn points via the Microsoft Rewards program. Both Microsoft Edge's dark and light themes look elegant and are easy to navigate. Privacy stalwarts, rejoice! Tor now has an official (and modern-looking) Android app. The Tor project operates under the principle that \"internet users should have private access to an uncensored web.\" Make sure to read the overview of how Tor works before you start using it, as it addresses specific types of privacy threats (and does so very well). The Tor browser may perform more slowly than other browsers, given its complicated inner workings, but that drawback should be negligible for the users who appreciate and rely on its protections. Language Learners If you're looking to learn another language, Duolingo gamifies language learning with bite-sized lessons and a friendly interface. Starting with simple vocabulary and building from there, Duolingo is your guide to learning a new language or brushing up on one you already know. The more you use the app, the more you unlock and—with practice—the more you learn. This free app currently supports Danish, Dutch, French, German, Irish, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish. Or more practical choices, like Esperanto and Klingon. The problem with most mobile messengers is convincing your friends to sign up. That said, there's a good chance that most people you know are already on Facebook. This is handy, because the Facebook Messenger app is fantastic. It's simple, clean, and easily handles voice and video calling. Check out our feature on Facebook Messenger to discover its other capabilities. Many people fear not being unable to communicate with people from another country while traveling. Google Translate takes a bit of the edge off, quickly translating either written text or spoken words. You can even use the app to do the speaking for you, and input text through your camera or handwriting. The app can translate 103 languages with a data connection and 52 when you're offline. It can't handle Tamarian, but it's sure to be a handy tool here on Earth. Another option is Microsoft Translator, which offers 60 offline languages, travel phrasebooks, a real-time conversation mode, and actually translates Klingon. LingoDeer is a fantastic language-learning tool with a strong Asian-language focus (though it includes a few major European languages, too). The app's courses are multilingual, so if you wish to learn Japanese as a German speaker, this is the app for you. That said, LingoDeer is also quite challenging, as it features specific, high-level terminology and detailed grammatical explanations. Nonetheless, it is a superb resource, and the developer is constantly improving the app based on community feedback. Most people are probably familiar with LinkedIn as a service only visited in times of desperation—after being laid off, maybe, or after a day in the office so bad that you're just not going to take it anymore. The LinkedIn app aims, however, to be a companion to the LinkedIn web service that you check every day. Sure, there's the all-important profile pages showing off your work experience, and the handy tools for networking, but the service now includes visitor metrics and a newsfeed for a decidedly more social feel. It's sometimes the easiest way to reach out and make a business connection. It's like Facebook for grown-ups. With Snapchat, you quickly snap and exchange photos with one or several friends. The app also supports video snaps, as well as voice and video calling. The catch is that whatever you post vanishes after a day. It's just a fun and ephemeral way to share the world around you. There are many apps that pay lip service to security and privacy, but Signal was built from the ground up with the goal of letting people easily communicate without having to worry about being overheard. The Signal app is a complete phone and SMS client replacement (though it works just fine as a standalone app, too) for sending and receiving encrypted calls and messages. The app's look and feel continues to improve, too. Textra is an excellent alternative to Messages on Android. The app includes numerous customization options that you won't find with the stock messaging app, including custom contact colors, text bubble styles, and notification icons. Additionally, you get extra features such as text scheduling, the ability to blacklist contacts, and the option to rename group conversations. Textra also has excellent light and dark modes. In a world rife with messenger apps, WhatsApp is among the most successful, boasting an enormous and dedicated user base. Add to that an integrated web version that lets users take their chats to the desktop. This Facebook-owned app is bolstered by encrypted messaging provided by the minds behind Signal. It might just be the largest secure messaging service out there. Microsoft's Your Phone Companion app lets you link your Android phone and text from your Windows 10 PC. As a bonus, you can also quickly access photos from your camera, as well as manage your device notifications. The app setup is easy, and it's certainly more comfortable to type out longer responses on a physical keyboard than craft a message on your phone. If you don't want to think about buying ingredients, but still want to cook, Blue Apron is an excellent option. With reliable deliveries and great meals to choose from, this food delivery service lets you skip the trip to the grocery store. The sleek mobile app allows you to manage your account, schedule your deliveries, and save any recipes you want to revisit. Cookpad connects you with a vibrant array of recipes. Easily add favorite recipes, manage shopping lists, and find new recipes you'll love based on those you already like. Once you start using it, you'll have one less excuse to eat out. A quality homemade meal is one of life’s greatest comforts, so whip up a tasty dish using Copy Me That. This multipurpose tool lets you copy, organize, and manage recipes that you find online or input yourself. Customize your recipe collection with photos of your choosing, and organize them in whatever categories you want. The app is great for cutting through long-winded websites to get tight recipe copy, and it even provides a meal planner and shopping list to make cooking a cinch. Remember the bad old days of ordering food? You needed takeout menus, knowledge of the terrain (\"will they even deliver out here?\"), cash, and faith that the person jotting down your order got it right. Seamless takes care of all that, even letting you pay via credit card from your Android. The only drawback? It's not available in every city (or even every state), though it has expanded its range dramatically since it was first included on this list. Untappd helps you record each brew you try along with a rating and tasting notes. Think of it as Swarm for beer! No more staring at a tap list, trying to remember which ones you've had before. The app also has a vibrant community of beer drinkers that can point you toward new discoveries and an extensive list of beers. It's also a handy way to find your favorite brew near your current location. While it's not perfect, it can change the way you think of beer. It pays to be a little skeptical of crowd-sourced reviews, but Yelp tells you a lot more than just what people thought of a bar, restaurant, or just about any other place where you spend money. Many locations list hours of operation, contact information, and menus, making it easy to find the perfect spot in your neighborhood or a new city. The Adidas Running app, formerly called Runtastic PRO, can do much more than just track your favorite running routes. This excellent fitness app keeps track of all sorts of useful data and can return information-rich maps to help you plan future outings. Use it for cycling, hiking, and walking, too. Menstruators the world over will rejoice over Clue, a simple app with a beautiful design for tracking your period and predicting when the next will occur. Using the data you enter about your cycle—and other factors—you can use Clue to plan ahead, whether it's for pregnancy or just to keep ahead of your cycle. Reminders and a handy calendar tool can help take the guesswork out of life. Best of all, it's totally gender-neutral, and not the expected pink. Tracking your period isn't just about knowing the cycle, but also the other factors surrounding it. Eve by Glow lets you track physical and emotional states, which can lead to some important insights when you take the time to interpret your own data. Eve also boasts a vibrant community and a wealth of information about sexual health built right in. You might know Fitbit from its popular fitness trackers, but the app that powers those devices works well on its own, too. Using your just your smartphone (assuming you meet the minimum hardware requirements), this fitness app can count steps and log activities to help you achieve daily goals. There are also social features, so you can compete against your friends. It's a must-have (really, you must have it) for Fitbit users, but also a smart choice for anyone looking to be more active. This calorie counter and exercise tracker aims to help you lose weight the old-fashioned way—expending more calories than you take in. With its smart design and an extensive library of foods, it makes quickly logging the calories you take in and what you burn while exercising a snap. A barcode scanner makes it even easier to log that post-workout snack. This fitness app also plays nice with other such apps, so your data won't be tied up in just one place. MyFitnessPal won't give you a whole workout regimen, but it can make you more aware of your habits. PCMag has a full review of MyFitnessPal for the iPhone. Zocdoc makes it easy to research nearby doctors on your health insurance plan and book appointments from your phone. When you first sign up for the app, you can enter your insurance information manually or scan your card to get started. The app itself looks slick too, with a modern, bright design that makes the experience of scheduling visits less stressful. Zocdoc even saves your history of appointments and makes recommendations for future ones, so you can stay on top of your health history. If you want to record your own podcast, Anchor is likely one of the easiest ways to do it. This app lets you record by yourself or with friends and build out entire podcast episodes entirely from your phone. Anchor even implements some basic audio editing tools for perfecting each clip in the app. Recently, the service announced a monetization program for creators on the platform. Filled with both up-and-coming and established acts, Bandcamp is one of the most exciting music marketplaces there is. The app was initially built around streaming songs you'd already purchased on Bandcamp, but now it's a one-stop-shop for digital and physical band merch. If you want to keep your finger on the pulse of music, this is an essential app. Streaming services are all the rage, but if you still keep music locally, BlackPlayer is worth your attention. We particularly like the Discover option, which shuffles through 10-second previews of seldom-played tracks in your library continuously, until you decide on what to listen to next. There's also a built-in tag editor and a ton of customization options for button styles, fonts, themes, and now playing notifications. While Pandora may have introduced the world to streaming radio, LiveXLive has refined it. You can listen to what the service thinks you'll like, or try out one of its human-curated channels and playlists. It also has hyper-specific playlists that appeal to particular tastes and moods, such as Yacht Rock. If you aren't ready to subscribe to LiveXLive quite yet, you can try out its free version. Android has struggled with podcasts (they don't call 'em \"Droidcasts,\" after all), but Pocket Casts is here to help. This highly customizable app is great for chilling out with an episode of your favorite casts, and it can also sync among different devices so that you can pick up right where you left off. Time to start listening. Songkick is the bridge between the music in your digital collection and concerts in your area. Once installed, Songkick scans your device for tunes and then lets you see when and where your favorite artists are playing. If you see a show you're interested in, you can also purchase tickets all from within the app. Add multiple locations to Songkick to catch concerts when you're on the road. With its huge inventory of music, Spotify has become a mainstay for free, legal music streaming. You can shuffle through smartly selected songs, find your favorite albums, or explore one of the service's excellent playlists. Close ties with artists means that new tracks are sometimes available the same day they hit the shelves in record shops. Those still exist, right? Spotify also offers a limited free version. Though its interface is a bit tricky, Stitcher connects you with just about every podcast out there. Podcasts are organized by subject, or you can just search for a familiar title. Shows can, in turn, be organized into playlists for a continuous stream. Once you've exhausted all your favorites, let Stitcher recommend something new. With a special emphasis on sources like NPR, CNN, and ESPN, Stitcher has a little bit of everything. Adobe Lightroom is a powerful photo-editing app for mobile that retains many of the features from its desktop counterparts, Lightroom, which earned a three-and-a-half star rating, and Lightroom Classic, a five-star Editors' Choice winner. Some of its standout tools include raw camera file profiles, noise reduction, profile-based lens corrections, and advanced color and lighting sliders. Lightroom also notably syncs all these edits between the mobile and desktop apps. Remember Flickr? The venerable photo-sharing service is an Editors' Choice web service, and the Android app has a lot to recommend it, too. It's more about the art of photography than the meme- and selfie-packed Instagram. Offering a well-designed interface and excellent photo and video editing tools, Flickr is more valuable than ever. Plus, the app connects you to the vibrant community of photographers on the service. Best of all, it can automatically back up photos from your phone. Free users can upload up to 1,000 photos and a $50 per year subscription gets you unlimited online photo storage. Google Photos puts the search giant's powerful (and sometimes creepy) image magic into your phone. It can identify faces, even as they age over the decades, as well as animals, places, or objects. You can also search for photos from specific dates or locations. The impressive built-in Assistant can detect clutter or even create collages or animations on its own. The app is rounded out with editing tools and unlimited cloud storage if you make some minor compromises on upload quality. Google Photos also extends to photo prints; you can digitize physical photos with the built-in Photo Scan or even order a custom photo book. The companion Google Lens app can even report back information related to your images or photos by scanning them. It seems like just yesterday that Facebook-owned Instagram was adding video. Then direct messaging. Then advanced photo editing put it on par with Photoshop Express for image correction and manipulation. Instagram Stories is now far more popular than Snapchat's similar feature. And anti-bullying features should make it more palatable for some. With a clean, minimalist interface, Instagram is the current king of social photo apps. With tons of effects, controls over layers, drawing tools, and collages, PicsArt Photo Studio can contend with Photoshop and is one of the best photo editing apps for Android. If you think it's just a lowly Instagram clone, you're wrong. When you're looking to take your smartphone snapshots to the next level, seek out this app. Don't get us wrong, some of us love Instagram. But if you want more control than Instagram affords, try Google-owned Snapseed. This app straddles the line between full-fledged image editor and filter app, all in a sleek and attractive package. Best of all is the amount of control it gives you over how filters and effects are applied to your images. It even lets you make non-destructible edits to raw camera files and make adjustments to exposure and detail levels. Asana is the 800-pound gorilla of task management for teams, dwarfing other popular services like the capable Trello. Asana is all about workflows and checkbox tasks that can be assigned to individuals. The Android app lets you take your tasks on the go and offline, syncing your progress when you're back on the network. It's a powerful tool with an excellent interface, and new features are added regularly. The hardest part of scheduling a meeting is getting everyone to agree. Jeff is free Monday and Wednesday. Jill is available Monday, but not Tuesday. And the other dozen people have their own schedules to contend with. Doodle lets you suggest times, and then see which work best for everyone. It's an invaluable planning tool. Once you start using Evernote, this note-taking app becomes a powerful tool for organizing just about everything. Notes can be anything—text, images, audio, or a mix—and are organized into notebooks. One of its killer features is optical character recognition, which makes the text in images searchable. Cloud-storage makes it the perfect tool for organizing the little pieces of a project into a finished draft. Faxing isn't dead quite yet, but fax machines can safely be left behind thanks to online fax services. Fax.Plus's app is well designed and easy to use. It notably offers a digital signature tool and a contact manager. We like how mobile fax apps allow users to snap a picture of an attachment, attach a fax cover sheet, and send a fax off to a recipient in a few quick actions. Fax.Plus makes this process seamless. IFTTT, which stands for \"if this, then that,\" helps you create custom automations between various online services and devices without any coding experience. The mobile app makes it simple to set up these Applets (previously called recipes) on your own or implement any of the community-created ones. IFTTT is particularly great for controlling smart home devices. Avoid paying for expensive textbooks and use Khan Academy instead. With lessons and videos for Arts & Humanities, Computing, Economics & Finance, Math, and more, there's no shortage of topics you can learn or review. The app is easy to use, and you can resume lessons wherever you sign in to your account. Microsoft Word is, simply put, the alpha and omega of word processing, and one of the key apps in Microsoft Office 365. You'll find it on every kind of computer in every kind of setting, and now it's available for free on Android. Word plugs into Microsoft's cloud infrastructure to keep your documents in order, but its main selling point is that this really is Word. What you make on your phone will look exactly the same on the desktop. For the worker on the go, it's essential. Mint is a fantastic online service to keep track of your finances, and it really shines on Android. Once you've entered all your information, you can easily check up on your finances on the fly. Mint keeps you on track for your goals and a new bill paying feature makes sure that you never miss a payment. Be sure to try out the app's excellent widgets, too. Nine is a very reliable email client designed to work with all of your accounts. The clean interface and the optional conversation view make reading and replying to email intuitive. One of the coolest features is the ability to customize the notification actions, including an incredibly useful \"Mark as read\" option. It isn't cheap, but it's only a one-time $14.99 charge for a much-improved email experience that also integrates calendar, contacts, notes, and tasks functionality. Slack has gone from the new hotness, to controversial productivity tool, to essential office tool faster than you can say \"hot take.\" With a familiar, instant messenger feel, it's easy to get started with Slack. But the service became popular because of its wealth of advanced features, like customizable alerts and a Do Not Disturb function. You can even host VoIP calls through Slack with your coworkers. A free account will get you started, but a monthly fee unlocks even better search tools. And be sure to install the Giphy plugin for maximum productivity. Reading email can be a slog, as they just don’t feel as natural or accessible as, say, text messages. Until now. Spike is an app that transforms your email inbox into a messenger platform, giving it a WhatsApp-style conversation flow. You can perform traditional email tasks, such as forwarding or scheduling messages, but the radically different inbox appearance will change your email perspective. A personal account is free, so give Spike a shot. Once you switch you may never go back to traditional emails inboxes again. If you like to keep your life organized with various to-do lists, then you definitely need to download Todoist. This app lets you keep track of the tasks you need to get done; you can assign them different priorities based on their overall importance or organize them across different projects. It also has a functional, clean design and works across many different platforms. Anyone can get started for free, but seriously organized individuals should upgrade to the $28.99 per year premium plan to set up task labels and reminders, upload files, and view productivity charts. Everyone needs to file their taxes every year. Most people will probably have an easier time using dedicated tax software (and some might still enjoy preparing them by hand), but more ambitions filers or those with simple tax returns can get away with using a mobile app. Intuit's TurboTax Tax Return App is the best one we reviewed this year. Among its top features are an excellent user interface, support for all major tax forms, and innovative help options. If you get stuck at any point, you can just open up the Virtual Assistant, which keeps a running dialogue of the help topics you searched for, or use SmartLook to connect to a tax expert via video chat. Calibre is the giant of ebook management, and this app is the perfect (ahem) companion for it. With just a few clicks, you can add any book from your computer to your eReader over USB or Wi-Fi. You can also store your ebooks on the cloud for easy access from wherever you are. What's so surprising is how well it works, and how easy it is to use. If you've got a lot of ebooks and are ready to cast off the shackles of Amazon, this is the app for you. The Amazon-owned ComiXology—the iTunes of digital comics—offers a near-perfect combination of store and comic book reader in its wonderful Comics app. The free app transforms your Android smartphone or tablet into a digital long box that houses and syncs your purchases across multiple devices. Even better, the new Comixology Unlimited service lets you devour an ever-expanding catalog of titles for just $5.99 per month. What is most impressive about the ESPN Android app is the sheer number of sports it covers. Everything from American football to Brazilian soccer to Indy 500 is available. For those unmissable games, you can set alerts and follow specific matches as they unfold. It also connects you to videos and news headlines, courtesy of the popular sports cable network. Also, check out ESPN's streaming service, ESPN+. Feedly takes the RSS feed into the modern age, and it's the easiest way to stay on top of all your favorites sources of news. You can view everything all at once if you want, but Feedly also lets you categorize your sources for focused reading or use its Today tab, which shows you the top stories from each category. Additionally, you can make Feedly look as simple as you wish, with minimalist text-only layouts. It's a great way to keep informed with the days' headlines and it offers useful integrations with other services as well. With its slick, streamlined interface, Flipboard is one of the best apps for reading the news. With it, you browse the articles, videos, podcasts, and other media that matter most to you. The app's signature magazine-style interface lets you explore the day's headlines in a gorgeous environment. The Daily Edition feature gives you the most important news along with themed stories for each day of the week. Flipboard has been one of our top picks for years, and it's easy to see why. The official Amazon Kindle app puts all of your existing Amazon ebook purchases at the tips of your fingers, and it gives you mobile access to the Kindle ebook store for impulse purchasing. Best of all, it syncs your notes, bookmarks, and where you left off among all your devices. The library is an often-overlooked public resource (and some are modernizing quickly), but OverDrive brings it back into the fold with the newly redesigned, Libby. Supported by over 30,000 libraries worldwide, the app lets you access your local library's array of available ebooks and audiobooks. Use it to download titles, place holds on titles not yet available, and consume your borrowed content. The only requirement is a library card (or its digital equivalent). Your bag of holding for internet content, Pocket saves articles, images, and videos for later reading. We especially like how it reformats articles for more comfortable reading on a mobile device, and how it syncs content to your tablet, phone, and online account. With the close integration between Pocket and the Android sharing tools, you can pocket just about anything from your phone. There's no shortage of Reddit apps on the Google Play store and choosing one over another ultimately comes down to preference, but reddit is fun (RIF) is a great option to try. The default view features a dense, text-heavy layout that puts the best (and worst) of Reddit front and center. There's both a light and dark theme and tons of layout content customization options to try out, even if you don't opt for the paid version. Better yet, there are no ads in either version or RIF and its overall performance is extremely quick. Need Android antivirus? It's hard to do better than Bitdefender. This app has received perfect scores from two independent research labs and scans your phone in mere seconds. It also includes excellent phishing protection, powerful antitheft tools, and Android Wear integration. As far as password managers go, Bitwarden checks all the right boxes. For instance, it supports two-factor authentication and secure password sharing. Bitwarden also implements a password generator and can help you import passwords from other services. Best of all, it's free and open-source. You're terrible at passwords. Don't take it personally! Everyone is terrible at passwords. That's why we all need apps like Dashlane, which generate, save, and replay login credentials wherever they're needed. This smart, cross-platform service makes sure that your passwords, payment information, and other vital information is stored securely but never out of reach. After a major overhaul to this powerful password manager, its appearance finally matches its performance. With LastPass, you can access your saved passwords, secure notes, and filled forms from your Android, and you can also create new ones that sync to all your devices. The new version of the app ingeniously melds the password manager with a built-in browser, putting the app's auto-login features at the forefront. Staying safe has never been easier. Kaspersky for Android bundles on-demand malware scans and active web protection. Additionally, it implements a host of anti-theft features including remote locate, lock and wipe, as well as the ability to sound an alarm. You can even lock apps behind a PIN as an extra preventative measure in case your phone gets stolen. Although you need a paid Kaspersky Internet Security subscription to use all its features, some basic functionality is available for free. It's a top choice for Android antivirus apps. SMS-based two-factor authentication is a common option, but when a service supports authentication apps, you should use that option. Microsoft Authenticator, like other time-based, one-time passcode authentication apps, lets you add accounts via a numeric or QR code and use the generated codes to log in to your services. Microsoft's app excels in its simplicity and extra features such as cloud backup (for when you are moving to a new device) and an optional app lock. You either enter the number displayed in the app, a two-digit number displayed by the service you're trying to authenticate or simply hit Allow in the popup notification. With NordVPN you can rest assured that no prying eyes will see your internet traffic. This app sports an excellent interface, a handy server selection tool, and hundreds of available VPN servers across the globe. NordVPN's signature feature is its assortment of specialized servers, which are optimized for activities like peer-to-peer downloading, video streaming, and access to Tor. Your Gmail inbox is not secure. Use ProtonMail instead. This encrypted email platform offers a range of pricing options, including a free tier, so you have no excuse not to join. Security and privacy features aside, ProtonMail works like any other email app. Make sure to also check out ProtonVPN for securing your network traffic; it's an Editors' Choice for free VPNs. Qustodio is an excellent parental control software that makes it easy to manage your child's mobile activity, especially with its well-designed companion app. Its best features are its browser-independent web content filters and ability to set device usage time limits. Rounding out its capabilities are location tracking, call and SMS logging, and mobile application blocking. Parents will also appreciate the instant device-locking and panic button options. VPNs are complex, but TunnelBear's VPN app isn't. TunnelBear graces the experience with bright colors, clear options, and, best of all, lots of friendly bears. This VPN undergoes annual third-party audits and offers top capabilities, including split tunneling on Android. TunnelBear offers a traffic-limited free version, too. Amazon is the internet's marketplace; the one place where you can buy just about anything—and it's cheap too! On Android, two of our favorite features are the integrated Alexa voice commands and the photo search, which makes it easy to surreptitiously compare Amazon's prices to those of the brick and mortar stores it is killing. Amazon Video-related functionality has been moved over to a dedicated app, but all of its other consumer services, including Fresh and Restaurants, make an appearance. Prime members rejoice; there's never been a better way to stay connected with your Amazon lifestyle. Google Pay has gone through many permutations over the years. Formerly known as Google Wallet, this person-to-person payment app from Google lets you easily send money without pesky cash or credit cards getting in the way. And in that role, it really excels. It's a strong alternative to our top choice, Venmo. The original deal locator for mobile, Groupon partners with businesses to offer low prices to a limited number of people for a limited time. While the value of Groupon's offerings is sometimes debatable, it offers a useful way to try a new restaurant or a totally new activity in your area. Pinterest is a social network of stuff, a place to \"pin\" things that interest you on themed boards. The Android app offers a great way to gather images from around the web for making lists or just collections of stuff that catch your eye. You could use it to help redecorate your living room or even to help you choose a tattoo artist. It easily integrates with your browser for fast pinning, and you can view the pins of others for added inspiration. For all our technical savvy and disruptive startups, physical package delivery is still ecommerce's backbone. The Slice app automatically detects shipping details from your email and then tracks the packages for you. You can watch your precious commodities make their stately way to your doorstep, get alerts when they are delivered, and even receive warnings if they've been recalled or the price has dropped. In short, Slice is an online shopper's best friend. There are many ways to pay for items with your phone, but Venmo has a smart mixture of clean design, ease of use, and social functions that give it an edge. Venmo doesn't do much, but it does let you easily send and receive payments from friends. And unlike other payment systems, Venmo has momentum. It's usually the app people ask about when the group is splitting up the check. Airbnb should be your go-to app for finding rooms, apartments, homes, and other unique accommodations when traveling, if you don't want to go with a traditional hotel. The length of your stay need not be short-term either; some locations let you book a stay for several months, which may appeal to people working temporary jobs in new places. This travel app also highlights other experiences and restaurants, so you can find out about everything a locale offers. If you're traveling within a major metropolitan area via either public transportation or personal vehicle, Citymapper can plan all your trip details. It has transit information for dozens of major U.S. cities and international hotspots in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Further, it offers multiple transportation options for each city, so if you feel like taking the ferry to work one morning, there's nothing stopping you. Its top features include Commute, which lets you set up your daily travel to and from work, and an alert system that uses natural language to describe service delays or cancellations. If an event isn't being organized on Facebook, it's probably being done through Eventbrite. This service makes it easy to manage invites, RSVPs, and even ticket purchasing. Attendees get handy reminders about the events they planned to attend, organizers can see guest lists. We particularly like that Eventbrite can generate QR codes, making event check-in a breeze. Google Maps has been your guide for years, and this excellent app just keeps getting better. With just a few taps, Google Maps tells you exactly how to get to your destination. It even supports walking, bicycle, and mass-transit directions, as well as Uber. The app's road knowledge is so keen that it can tell you which lane to be in while using turn-by-turn directions. And because this is Google, you can easily search for locations nearby. While true that this app is can't be uninstalled, it's still the best map app you'll find. Although a weather app's primary function is to give an accurate forecast, the presentation of that data is also important. Overdrop manages to accomplish both feats. The app includes helpful timeline-based graphs of temperature, wind, and rain predictions. Furthermore, you can change the units of measurement that the app displays as well as the weather provider. Your choices are Dark Sky or Weather Bit. Who needs Uber when so many cities offer world-class public transit? The Transit app shows mass transit options—including buses, ferries, and trains—and the estimated time of arrival in 87 cities in North American, Europe, and Australia. Here in New York, it even tells you how many bikes are parked at local Citi Bike stands. This app keeps you in the know no matter where your travels take you. Uber certainly has its problems. Between its questionable business tactics and its bad press, it's understandable to be suspicious. But the truth is that if you're looking for a way to get a ride, regardless of what city you're in, Uber will be there. You can even use it to order food in some areas. A great feature: You can request a wheelchair-accessible vehicle through Uber. Weather Underground combines a slick design with a focus on really useful weather information. We particularly like the ability to report weather conditions in your area and the extremely useful comparative forecasts that deftly show how conditions have changed since yesterday. With an accompanying set of useful widgets, it's the best weather app on Android. Dropbox pioneered the personal cloud service, where all your stuff would be available no matter what device you were using. On Android, it holds its own—even against the highly integrated Google Drive. Dropbox can also act as a seamless backup for your images, automatically uploading every photo to the cloud. It even includes some light image editing tools. If you're the type of person with lots of files already stored in Dropbox, this app is a must-have. Grammarly Keyboard corrects your grammar and spelling errors as you type. This keyboard is useful for everything from writing emails to composing social media posts to editing long-form documents. In use, Grammarly makes it easy to accept changes or access a card-based interface with more in-depth explanations of an error. It also offers a good number of visual customizations, such as a choice between a light or dark theme options and the keyboard height, as well as editing options, such as auto-correction and capitalization preferences. Microsoft OneDrive is one of the best cloud storage services. With apps for all your devices, a clean interface, and excellent organization tools, it's a seamless way to keep your files with you wherever you go. Free users get 5GB of storage, but if you subscribe to Office 365, that limit goes up to 1TB. Microsoft's Personal Vault feature is built-in too, which helps you keep sensitive information behind an additional layer of security. Microsoft Launcher can replace your Android phone's default launcher with a useful and customizable feed for quick access to recent apps, events, and frequently contacted people. You can view the main app list horizontally or vertically, and it includes an elegant alphabetical scrollbar for reaching apps quickly. Performance is just as smooth as the stock launcher, and it doesn't affect the use of Google Assistant, though of course, Cortana feels more at home as your voice assistant with this launcher. Network Analyzer makes it easy to view information about all of the Wi-Fi networks nearby. With a few taps, you can see the strength of networks in the area on a dynamic graph and view detailed information about your connection, such as your IPv4 Address, MAC Address, and Default Gateway IP. You can even run a network query from within the app; it lets you Ping an IP/Domain Name or even check the DNS Server settings. It's the perfect companion to our article on how to find your IP address. Otter is an innovative automatic recording and transcription service that works in real-time. Simply hit the record button during a conversation or meeting and Otter will produce a usable transcript a few minutes later. Otter's app is fluid, well-designed, and quick in operation, which makes it ideal for students and professionals who rely on their mobile devices for their work. The app also integrates other top-notch features such as cross-conversation speaker identification, excellent search tools, and in-app editing of transcripts. Are you curious about the speed of your Internet connection? Ookla's Speedtest app makes it easy to test your latency as well as upload and download speeds. The app also keeps a log of test results so you can compare performance over time. IF you want, you can also export your results for further analysis. PCMag relies on Ookla's tools every year to pick the fastest ISPs. (Note: Ookla is owned by Ziff Davis, PCMag's publisher.) Game-streaming platforms and subscriptions are all the rage right now, with big-name players such as Apple (Arcade), Google (Stadia), and Microsoft (xCloud) all recently launching some sort of effort. Steam Link (still in beta) allows you to play games from your Steam library directly from your Android phone, with the caveat that both your PC and mobile device must be connected to the same network. Check out our guide on how to stream games on your Android or iOS device. An impressive keyboard replacement, SwiftKey Keyboard suggests what it thinks is the most likely next word as you type. A pioneer of this technology, SwiftKey can speed up your typing by inserting whole words with a tap. The app also supports Swype-like input, over 100 languages, and 80 colorful themes. Let's be honest: Tasker is very intimidating. But we recognize that this is perhaps the most powerful app available in Google Play. With it, you can script basic actions for your Android to perform when specific conditions are met—like flash the LED when you receive a text message. Learning to use something this powerful can be tricky, but the rewards seem worth it. fuboTV is a great option for any cord-cutting sports fans. This \"sports-first, but not sports-only\" service offers extensive live sports and entertainment content (85 channels) for all your devices. Whether you want to watch NFL games on Sunday, catch up an MLB game that aired during the day, or even stream a movie on-demand, fuboTV has you covered. fuboTV also offers excellent DVR capabilities and other features for watching events and shows you may have otherwise missed. In testing, streaming live and on-demand shows worked very well. Hulu has long been a major player in the on-demand streaming space and its large library of current and previously aired shows offer appealing options for many. Hulu's live TV component is impressive as well, with a good range of channels and well-designed apps. Hulu's combination of on-demand and live TV services makes it an excellent value. Despite ups and downs in the quality of its library, Netflix dominates the world of streaming TV and movies. The service also creates its own—sometimes indispensable—content, including original comedies, cartoons, dramas, and documentaries. Some of the shows have become cultural phenomena, making Netflix a must-have. Shows such as Black Mirror, Stranger Things, and The Crown (the most expensive TV show ever made) are often the conversation topics of the day. You can even download select episodes to watch offline at your leisure. Twitch is the best way to watch people play games or pursue their creative hobbies on your mobile device. From eSports to cooking to music and more, there's likely some content on Twitch that everyone can enjoy. If you are feeling generous, you can also support your favorite creators directly from the app. Twitch Prime members can also claim free games and in-game loot each month. With the Yahoo Sports app, you can watch live NFL games in your area as well as primetime matchups at no cost. The app is also useful for keeping up with the scores and highlights from other national sports leagues. A well-designed layout and solid performance in testing make it a worthwhile download. YouTube TV is one of the best video streaming services for streaming live channels, with an excellent combination of news, sports, and entertainment options. The service also offers top-notch apps and excellent DVR functionality. YouTube TV's streaming performance is excellent, too.

Today, there are 2.87 million apps available for download on the Google Play Store. Meanwhile, the Apple App Store has 1.96 million apps available.* There’s not just one app for “that,” there are now literally hundreds of choices for any use case you can dream of. Quick answer: because we have so many needs and many of them can be solved with an app. A year ago, we analyzed over 250 apps with an average of 30,000 DAUs each to see how COVID-19 was affecting app usage and mobile habits. And the results were staggering: Some app industries (like streaming media, ecommerce, and fintech) saw a surge in user engagement — often as high as a 177% average increase in daily active users (DAUs). Meanwhile, struggling industries (like travel, event ticketing, and hospitality) saw 60 to 80% fewer app launches. The world suddenly had very specific needs and turned to apps to scratch that itch. Below, we feature the top 10 most popular apps in the free, paid, and highest-grossing categories — in both the App Store as well as Google Play.  Image: App Annie 1) 911 Emergency Dispatcher No surprise that a game makes the top spot in the free tier. What is a surprise is that you simulate a series of decisions that a real-life 911 dispatcher might have to deal with. Although, granted someone calling 911 to order a burger would probably receive a sterner warning than “LOL Goodbye.” 2) YouTube Videos. All day. All the time. For when your attention span is not long enough for Netflix. Or when you need to fix something in the house that you really should hire a professional for. 3) TikTok For when your attention span is not even long enough for YouTube. Or when you intend to finally give in and attempt the latest kpop dance. 4) ESPN Tournament Challenge With any sports season, you’ll need a bracket app to organize your picks and compete against friends, even ESPN personalities and celebrities, to see who finishes with the best bracket. 5) Finger on the App 2 Coming from the mind of pro gamer Mr. Beast, this game is simple: compete with other players online to keep your finger on the app for as long as possible. The final winner gets $100,000. Watch out for the hackers and bots, though! 6) Instagram Photos! With filters! And comments from your social network. Mostly just hearts. 7) Facebook Social networking for parents and developing nations! And reactions from your well-meaning circle, though mostly just thumbs-ups. 8) Messenger Instant messaging for Facebook account holders to converse with other Facebook stalwarts. 9) Snapchat The originator of self-destructing content remains a favorite. 10) Gmail And of course, Google’s own email app rounds off the top 10 free apps in the App Store. 1) Minecraft The appeal of building worlds made out of blocks and adventuring in those worlds with your remote friends appears to be evergreen. Also, the devs keep adding new and interesting content to keep the game fresh. 2) Bloons TD 6 A cute tower defense game that involves talented monkeys defending the path from invading balloons. As expected, highly addictive. Unlike similar casual games though, this one charges you even before you install. 3) Heads Up! It’s a charades game using your phone. You position the phone above your head to show your teammate the clue that they now have to get you to guess. Instant small group fun. 4) Procreate Pocket Digital painting and illustration on your iOS device. Really simple to use and provides a truly vital component for any digital art: the ability to use layers. 5) Geometry Dash A musical side-scrolling flight adventure where you travel a geometric landscape, avoid geometric obstacles. Because it’s paid, there are no ads. Awesome music too. 6) HotSchedules This is the only entry that isn’t a game. Instead, it’s a timecard and calendar app used for scheduling your shifts, inputting time and attendance, and even making sure your company abides with compliance. 7) Monopoly Just like the board game, but on a digital device. And without all that fake paper money flying about. Though, truth be told, that’s the fun of the board game, right? 8) Plague Inc. A strategy and simulation game about trying to successfully infect the world. Umm… isn’t that a tad too close to reality? Apparently, not for gamers. 9) Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas But if you need the ultimate escapist game with a healthy side of violence, then GTA lets you engage in gunfights, commandeer all sorts of wheeled vehicles, and live life as a gangsta. 10) Papa’s Mocharia To Go! It’s a time management restaurant preparation game. Prepare the drinks quickly! Please your customers! And don’t forget to tamp down the coffee grounds before pouring the milk. 1) Roblox More blocky multiplayer fun with friends. But why is it consistently a high grosser? Because it’s not a single game. Roblox is a gaming platform for its community to develop or buy new games (or game items) built with the main engine. 2) YouTube Isn’t YouTube all about the free videos? Oh, they haven’t been for a while. Users can now buy or rent movies, subscribe to specific streams like online gaming or sporting, or simply cough up the monthly price for an ad-free YouTube premium subscription. 3) Tinder No longer just swipe left or right. Tinder Plus allows users to undo swipes, match with people overseas, get people’s attention via super likes, and deploy monthly “boosts” to increase profile visibility. For a monthly fee, of course. 4) Disney+ Streaming everything from Mickey Mouse to Jabba the Hutt to Baby Groot. And getting us to part money for the chance to watch content only available on their platform. 5) Candy Crush Saga A tried and true formula: match 3 of the same type and if you run out of all your 5 lives, pay for more with in-app purchases. In 2020 alone, Candy Crush Saga brought in more than $720 million.* Now that’s a lot of extra lives. 6) Twitch Aside from ads, this video streaming app makes money through its two subscription models, the Amazon-affiliated Twitch Prime, as well as Twitch Turbo. Because we all need more video! 7) Pokemon Go This augmented reality monster collection game is still going strong, making money not just through in-app purchases, but also through sponsored locations and unique user events. 8) BIGO LIVE This live streaming platform from Singapore gives users the chance to stream their games live, live chat with people around the globe, or simply be an online social media influencer. With in-app purchases of course. 9) PUBG MOBILE This battle royale shooter game is still kicking years after its launch thanks to its addictive gameplay and ardent community of fans. How does it earn so much? In-app purchases and ads. 10) HBO Max Finally, this subscription streaming app features its own unique content alongside movies from Warner Bros., DC, Studio Ghibli, and much more.  Image: App Annie 1) Finger on the App 2 2) Google Pay Google’s own cashless payments app is hugely popular — particularly in markets where Android is the dominant mobile OS. 3) TikTok 4) ZOOM Cloud Meetings And where would we be without our regular Zoom calls for both work and remote socializing? Having to settle for Google Hangouts perhaps? 5) Comics Bob You know all those ads you get for puzzle games? Well this is probably the best of the bunch. You’ll have to decide correctly to proceed with the story of Caveman Bob and his girl as they tackle romance, dinosaurs, and mad science. 6) IRS2Go With the tax deadline looming in North America, it’s no wonder that this is in the top 10 free apps list. With this, a user can check their tax refund status, make a payment, or even find free tax preparation assistance. 7) Tubi Another video streaming app? Even better, it’s free (ad-supported, naturally). Apart from the usual Hollywood fare (the older movies), this app has a wide selection of international fare: from Korean dramas and Japanese anime to British drama series. 8) Ice Man 3D First-person shooter game, except here you’re shooting ice rays from your hands. Cool! 9) Cash App This is Square Inc.’s mobile banking app. With this, users can send, spend, save, or invest money. 10) Disney+ 1) Minecraft 2) Bloons TD 6 3) Monopoly 4) Geometry Dash 5) Stardew Valley What can be more relaxing than a farming RPG? Participate in heart events, grow crops, tend animals, and you don’t have to deal with the smells of a real farm. 6) Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas 7) Terraria Think Minecraft but side-scrolling and using 8-bit characters. This sandbox, world-building multiplayer game is an adventure that up to 8 players can play simultaneously, even via local wifi. 8) Ultimate Custom Night It’s a spinoff of Five Nights at Freddy’s (see below), but this horror survival game allows you a world of customization that the original games could not give. 9) Five Nights at Freddy’s This game has a simple premise: survive 5 nights at a pizza parlor haunted by evil animatronic robot mascots. Chucky meets Chuck E. Cheese! 10) The Game of Life 2 Based on the original Hasbro board game, this digital update allows you many more modern choices. Become a pop star or a surgeon? Maybe a vlogger? Plus, it’s ad-free since it’s paid. 1) Coin Master This game is really just a slot machine. Spin to win. But it cleverly adds other dimensions: you collect pets and cards, raid other villages, build up your own village, and explore new worlds. And watch a ton of rewarded video ads in the process. 2) Garena Free Fire This is a survival battle game like Fortnite or PUBG. And like those competitors, they rake in the cash by offering season passes as well as in-app purchases. 3) Candy Crush Saga 4) Google One Really simple app for automatically backing up your phone and managing your Google cloud storage. Simply pay for a membership and you’re in. 5) Lords Mobile: Kingdom Wars While it’s a free-to-play multiplayer game involving battle formations with some role-playing, it monetizes through the usual IAPs, in particular battle passes, purchasable characters, and unique player gear. 6) Disney+ 7) Roblox 8) Pokemon Go 9) Genshin Impact Another free-to-play game, but this time an RPG with anime-style graphics. It monetizes through IAPs that give you a chance (not an assurance) to win what you spent real money for (much like the Japanese toy vending machine, called Gacha). 10) Twitch What do these 60 apps all have in common? And what brought them to such heights of popularity? If you take a close look at each of them, you’ll soon realize they each stake a claim on a specific area of our lives by getting us to cultivate a habit. So much so that if you have 10 minutes before a Zoom meeting, the apps you habitually reach for are probably listed above. You want to be entertained? Go for YouTube or TikTok or Disney+. You want to capture a moment? Instagram or Facebook or Snapchat. You want to talk with a friend? Zoom or Messenger. You have some time to kill? PUBG or Garena Free Fire or Bloons TD 6! Every one of the above apps is able to engage users and keep them coming back so often that it’s second nature to them. And that’s a great way to build up loyal users. Nir Eyal, author of Hooked, says: “Once a habit is formed, the user is no longer considering whether they should open an app — they check the app every day, automatically, without thinking much about it.” And that’s the secret to their success, which hopefully you get to build into your own apps: these are the apps that users return to every day, whether they’re conscious about it or not.

        "body": "The latest smartphones come packed with a bevy of features right out of the box, but to reach their true potential you’ll likely want to delve into the vast marketplace of third-party apps. Since the launch of the Android Market (now known as the Google Play Store) in 2008, apps have been steadily improving the Android experience. From the apps that help with daily tasks like balancing a checkbook or calculating a tip, to integrated apps with business communication platforms, there’s an app out there for every purpose. With more than 3 million apps listed on the Google Play Store, the choices can be a bit overwhelming. We’ve done the work of putting together a list of the 100 best Android apps across a number of categories to help you pick the best apps for your daily life. Here are the best Android apps to download onto your Android device. Can 2 billion people be wrong? The biggest social network on the planet has a decent official app. Keep up with your friends and family, jump into instant chats, and stay informed with push notifications. Best of all, Facebook isn’t just a place to share content stolen from Reddit and Twitter, as the world’s biggest social media site has also been pushed out into sections for dating, shopping, and videos. Pair it with Messenger for the ultimate double-act. GOOGLE PLAY It’s probably the Android app, so it’s likely you have YouTube already — but that doesn’t make it any less essential. YouTube’s mobile app is sleek and intuitive, bringing the entirety of the video-sharing site to the palm of your hand. For those subscribed to YouTube Premium, you’ll have access to all the premium content, as well as special features like audio playback while the screen is off. But even when used as a free app, YouTube is essential. GOOGLE PLAY Sometimes unfairly viewed as the lesser version of Facebook, Twitter is the place where everything seems to happen instantly. Birthplace of the now now-ubiquitous internet facet, the hashtag, Twitter is the best place to be if you like to be on top of the latest breaking news as it happens. Follow your favorite content creators, actors, or crazes, and follow all the news, impressions, and opinions as they roll in. GOOGLE PLAY If you’re spending more time at home than usual, you might finally have the time to get to that connected-home project you always swore you’d do. If you are the proud owner of a Google Home device, then you already know the ins and outs of a digital assistant. The Google Home app takes this one step further, allowing you to control a plethora of connected smart home devices. It also serves as a command central for any native Google-connected device and your Google-connected accounts, like maps, contacts, calendars, and more. Google Play Netflix isn’t just one of the best video-streaming services; it’s the video-streaming service. There’s a huge selection of Netflix movies and TV shows for subscribers and the performance is silky smooth. It’s not just restricted to old favorites either, as Netflix has produced a huge amount of excellent exclusive content — though if you’re anything like us, you’ll just put The Office on again. This is as entertained as you can get from just $9 a month, or $16 a month if you want access to 4K content. GOOGLE PLAY Disney holds possibly the largest library of film and television properties in the world and they are all on Disney+. From Hamilton to The Mandalorian you’ll find something for every member of the family. As theatergoers are slow to return all around the globe, Disney has begun using Disney+ for major blockbusters like Mulan and Soul. You’ll also have access to original television shows like Marvel’s The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. There’s a seven-day free trial, and it’ll cost you $6.99 a month after that — though you can pay $70 for a year in advance to save $14. In March 2021 this increased to $7.99 a month or $80 yearly. GOOGLE PLAY Though it only recently launched internationally, Hulu has long been one of the best streaming platforms around. Major network shows currently on air are typically available the next day on Hulu as well as thousands of hours of original content and a catalog of licensed TV shows. Hulu offers various subscription models, including one that opens up the entire streaming library for $6 a month, and another that removes midstream ads for $12 a month. If you’re looking to cut the cord, Hulu also offers live TV with DVR starting at $65 a month, but be aware it costs $5 more if you want to fast-forward through commercials on recorded episodes. GOOGLE PLAY The content wars have been raging for well over a decade, and every platform brings something to the table. Amazon Prime offers some fantastic originals on its streaming platform, which also serves as a great home base for its extensive catalog. Prime Video also allows you to add all your favorite subscription channels to your feed. We’ve also found the best movies on Amazon Prime to start watching today if you’re interested. GOOGLE PLAY With the streaming wars hotter than ever before AT&T wasn’t about to let Warner Media go without a fight. HBO Max launched in the summer of 2020 and brings with it all the HBO content audiences are already familiar with, with the added benefit of original content produced exclusively for the streaming platform. In 2021 HBO Max announced that all Warner property films will launch in theaters and on HBO Max simultaneously as studios clamor for return on investments in this new theater-less world, so you can catch blockbusters like Mortal Kombat from the comfort of your living room. Google Play Using an Android smartphone doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy one of Apple’s best current products. Apple TV+ is Apple’s answer to the ever-growing sector of streaming platforms. With hits like Emmy Award-winning Ted Lasso, Apple is establishing itself as a serious player in television and film development for at-home consumption. They’ve teamed up with the likes of Oprah, Prince Harry, Jon Stewart, and countless others to develop a respectable and growing library of content. Google Play Spotify is probably the first name that springs to mind when you think about music apps — and for good reason as it’s one of the best streaming services out there. There’s a massive selection of music on offer, from the latest huge releases to up-and-coming acts. Spotify also now offers video support for some of the best podcasts on their platform. There’s a free version if you want to try it out, but if you want ad-free listening, to download music, play any song, and have unlimited skips, then you’ll need to subscribe for $10 a month, though Spotify does offer a generous three-month free trial. Spotify also offers a family household plan for $15 a month, a student account at the reduced cost of $5 a month, and a “Duo” account covering two people in the same household for $13 a month. GOOGLE PLAY If you’re looking for an all-you-can-eat buffet of sound with no ads and no subscription fees, you’ve found it. You can discover new music and stream it from the cloud, but this is no Spotify replacement — most of the music on Soundcloud is from relatively unknown artists, and if you’re not able to find it on Spotify, you can probably find it here. Listening is free, with the pro versions of SoundCloud mostly being for the artists themselves. It’s not just about music, though, as you’ll find a lot of podcasts on here too. A great complement to another music streaming service. GOOGLE PLAY Believe it or not, radio is still alive and kicking, and iHeartRadio puts thousands of FM and AM radio stations right into your pocket. Not a lot of major smartphones in the U.S. have FM tuners, so we rely on great apps like iHeartRadio to listen to our favorite talk shows and oldies stations at the office, the gym, or on the go. The app also features podcasts, sports channels, and playlist tools. GOOGLE PLAY Google’s official streaming service is a worthy competitor to Spotify. Not only does the app provide a vast library of content, but it also allows users to upload up to 50,000 of their own songs for online storage. So if you’ve got a collection of MP3s from before the days when streaming was the normal way to consume music, upload them to Google Play Music and stream them from any of your mobile devices. Be warned though, it’s not long for this world. GOOGLE PLAY It’s hard to believe that Shazam was first released 19 years ago, blowing our collective minds and putting the concept of apps and their reach squarely in the zeitgeist. Today, Shazam’s integration and services go far beyond the simple song identifier it started as. Shazam can be activated passively to catch songs when the app isn’t open. Once you’ve identified a tune, you’ll be offered live lyrics to follow along with, as well as the option to add to your Apple or Spotify playlists.

        "body": "As they say, to err is human. It is human to make mistakes, but inhuman to abandon. And abandoning an idea is a sin. The mobile platform allows you to integrate the services of your company in the most efficient way possible. Apps are easily the best approach to establish your brand in an era where mobile apps impact every element of our life. An app is also a natural marketing tool. Do you want to start a business? Do you want to know the cost of making such apps? Do you want to introduce new mobile app concepts? The concept of creating an app is an important aspect of starting a successful company. It’s also critical to find the top mobile development companies in India to supply you with a team of professional offshore mobile app developers to help you construct a multibillion-dollar app without thinking about the crucial steps to creating such applications. We’ve compiled a list of 10 mobile app ideas that are expected to be popular in 2022. One of the main considerations when purchasing furniture or any other type of interior decoration is whether the item will fit in your room and where it will look best. An augmented reality software allows you to use your phone’s camera to place 3D representations of various goods and furnishings in a virtual location and see how they might appear. The app may also form partnerships with numerous shopping sites, allowing users to place orders directly from the app. Why should you let go an opportunity to dine at a fantastic location? For last-minute planning. This software will provide a graphical representation of neighboring pubs and restaurants, as well as the ability to reserve a certain table at a given time. As a result, it might be one of the most effective and straightforward application concepts. This app uses Artificial Intelligence to remember the user’s preferences and provide recommendations based on them. AI not only assists in the selection of superior dining establishments, but also makes them more customized. Do you want to create an AI-powered app? Hire mobile app developers adroit at creating Ai-powered apps on a full-time, hourly, or project-by-project basis and manage them as an extension of your staff to create a feature-packed app. Apps for food delivery are not a new concept. It’s been a while since they’ve made an appearance in people’s daily lives and phrases like ‘I’ll Swiggy in my lunch and Zomato that steak’ has slipped into our daily vocabulary. Covid-19, on the other hand, has boosted the rise of meal delivery applications. So now is the ideal moment to try your hand at developing a meal delivery app with some fresh ideas. For instance, an app that employs augmented reality to produce interactive menu cards to help consumers make better ordering decisions. This would give your food delivery app a new dimension and attract more clients. Mobile health technology better known as mHealth gives healthcare providers all the necessary information they may need at their fingertips. It also empowers patients to get engaged in their own healthcare. Doctors, patients, and healthcare providers have all benefitted from digital healthcare services. Doctor appointment apps are a valuable mobile app concept that may assist all parties involved to save time and effort. It might be an app that allows patients to arrange appointments on their own or through a physician. Patients would save time and money by not having to drive great distances or wait in big lines if they use such booking apps. The creation of doctor appointment apps is on the increase, and now is the best moment to invest in one. Payment apps based on the Unified Payments Interface, or UPI, are all the rage these days. It’s a real-time interbank payment system that lets you send and receive money. Money may be sent/requested using account number/IFSC code, cellphone number, virtual payment address, Aadhaar number, and even QR code if many bank accounts are linked to a single app. For nearly 6 million years, our forefathers have wandered this planet. As a result, the type of illnesses they discovered differs from place to location. People nowadays travel extensively outside of their hometowns. As a result, the basic components for such age-old Granny treatments may not always be available. As a result, the app concept to create a separate healthcare app was born. We offer an app that has a database of all home remedies, which is organized mostly along regional and cultural lines. The user’s present location will determine the type of medicine he or she can try. There’s also a requirement to categorize treatments according to their symptoms and illnesses. As a final resort, “call the doctor” can be included. Some of the big players in the market are PharmEasy and Netmeds. The fitness app can help fitness enthusiasts keep track of their daily calorie intake and workout condition. You can incorporate a chat feature that allows users to communicate with health experts and other members of the community. MyFitnessPal and Adidas Runtastic have changed the complexion of the industry by empowering the average joe to strive for fitness. People no longer think twice about conducting online purchases thanks to the Classified App. Buying and selling items online has grown quite prevalent in recent years. The popularity of classified applications such as OLX, Quikr, eBay, Go Local Classified and others demonstrates this. Classified applications are more adaptable and have a wider reach than e-commerce apps. Whether you have products to sell, want to assist people in finding the right buyer/seller, or want to use classified app development for marketing purposes, classified app development has you covered. Taxi app services have been in high demand since the start of Uber. Online taxi services will be used by 1588 million individuals by 2024. Even though it necessitates a certain amount of commitment, the good news is that you may double your investment within a financial year. The level of services you provide will determine the app’s success. Taxi app development is a viable industry to go into if you can guarantee high-quality service. Many shop owners and members of the general public have security systems installed in their homes. This program will use wi-fi to operate all these security devices, allowing the user to answer the door, examine camera video, and monitor locker/safe activity all from their smartphone. This is an idea that can be realized via the use of IoT app development and Blockchain development. For music enthusiasts, this may be one of the finest app ideas. This app will appear to be a standard mp3 player at first glance, but it will offer much more. It will notify people in the user’s contact list of what they are listening to, and if they like it, they will be able to share it with them so that they may both listen at the same time.

        "title": "The 20 Most Popular Android Apps in the Google Play Store",
        "link": "https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/most-popular-android-apps/",
        "desc": "LINE is the fourth-most popular instant messaging app on Android, behind WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Viber. Asia drives much of its popularity. It's in the top five communications apps in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Cambodia, and Indonesia. The app struggles to make the top 30 in most European and North American countries, however.",
        "body": "What are the most popular Android apps? Here are the most downloaded apps in the Google Play Store! Many of the Android apps we recommend aren't popular in the wider community. Of course, they're all excellent—we wouldn't suggest lousy apps—but often you can file them into the \"niche\" category. For something different, let's take a step back and look at some of the all-time most popular Android apps in the Google Play Store. These are the ones that Android's 2.8 billion active users have downloaded most frequently. We're not going to include apps that come pre-loaded on stock Android devices. This means we're excluding Google Play Services (10 billion \"downloads\"), Gmail (9 billion), Google Maps (6.9 billion), YouTube (10 billion), and a few others. We've used AndroidRank's data to determine these numbers. The numbers in parentheses denote the placement change from March 2020, when we last updated this list. 7.073 billion downloads It's not surprising to see Facebook as the world's highest downloaded app. Despite seemingly endless scandals, questionable privacy practices, and the #DeleteFacebook movement, it still reigns supreme. Not everyone is happy though, as this app has 76 million one-star ratings. Perhaps it's justified; the app is bloated with pointless features that few people bother to use. Download: Facebook (Free, in-app purchases available) 6.983 billion downloads In July 2018, WhatsApp was third with 2.9 billion downloads. A year ago it had jumped into number one, but now it has slipped back down to second. WhatsApp—which is the world's most popular instant messaging tool—has been under Facebook's ownership since a $19 billion buyout in early 2014. If you don't fancy using a Facebook-owned app messaging app, try out one of the many WhatsApp alternatives. Download: WhatsApp (Free) 5.327 billion downloads The presence of Messenger in the third position reinforces the control that Facebook's empire has over the smartphone app marketplace. Messenger has grown in popularity over the last few years, with the increased availability of bots making the service more useful than ever. It's down one place from July 2018 when we first published this list. Download: Facebook Messenger (Free, in-app purchases available) 3.504 billion downloads Instagram is yet another Facebook-owned app, which the company acquired in 2012. It has significantly fewer negative reviews than its big brother, with just 28 million (out of 121 million) giving the app a single star. Download: Instagram (Free, in-app purchases available) 2.631 billion downloads TikTok's ongoing growth shows no signs of abating. The app, which lets users create and share short video clips, became immensely popular during the first half of 2020 as the COVID crisis forced people to stay at home. It broke one billion downloads in July 2019 and has more than doubled in the following two years. Download: TikTok (Free, in-app purchases available) 1.438 billion downloads At number six, we find our first game—and it's not Candy Crush Saga! Subway Surfers is an endless runner game that sees you flee down a railroad in order to escape from a police officer and his dog. Download: Subway Surfers (Free, in-app purchases available) 1.933 billion downloads And we're already back to Facebook. The Lite version of the app is aimed at users with low-end devices (packing 1GB or 2GB of RAM) and those who only have access to 2G data networks. There are a few subtle usability changes, but all the main features are present and work as expected. Download: Facebook Lite (Free) 1.895 billion downloads Given the popularity of Word on the desktop, it should come as no surprise that the Android app has also found similar levels of success. Keep an eye on the Microsoft Office apps—they will almost certainly shoot even higher when we next update the list. Download: Microsoft Word (Free, subscription required for some features) 1.655 billion downloads Microsoft PowerPoint is the second consecutive Microsoft Office app on the list. You've likely used it at some point to create a presentation or slideshow. Download: Microsoft PowerPoint (Free, subscription required for some features) 1.350 billion downloads Snapchat concludes the list of the top 10 apps. Instagram might be stealing all of Snapchat's best features, but the latter still manages to rack up more than 280 million daily users, up from 240 million 12 months ago. However, as a percentage of the total downloads on Android and iOS combined, that figure remains low. Is it time to start worrying about the app's future or does the slight increase in rank point to a possible revival? Download: Snapchat (Free, in-app purchases available) 1.541 billion downloads It's not all about social networks and games with popular Android apps. SHAREit is the first non-Google productivity app to make the list. The app offers a way to transfer large files between devices in seconds. According to the developer, it's over 200 times faster than Bluetooth. Download: SHAREit (Free, in-app purchases available) 1.513 billion downloads Netflix now has almost 210 million subscribers. It saw a massive boost throughout 2020, again, thanks to COVID. The service's blend of original content and old favorites has proved to be a winning formula, and the growth is showing no signs of slowing down as we head through 2021. It is the only video-on-demand streaming app to make the top 20. Download: Netflix (Free, subscription required) 1.301 billion downloads It shouldn't be a surprise to see social media apps have several entries in the list of the most popular Play Store downloads. Twitter is now the fourth most popular social app. In 2018 it was third behind Facebook and Instagram, but Snapchat has also now leapfrogged it. Download: Twitter (Free) 1.301 billion downloads Flipboard is a curious app. It doesn't garner the same number of headlines as many of its competitors, but as the 1.3 billion downloads prove, it's hugely popular. In case you don't know, the app collates news, conversations, and compelling stories around any given topic, giving you a one-stop-shop for the subjects you care about. Download: Flipboard (Free) 1.142 billion downloads You probably thought Candy Crush Saga would be the most popular game in raw downloads, but it comes in second. Regardless, 1.1 billion Android users love trying to line up different-colored candies. Maybe it's time to find a new hobby? Download: Candy Crush Saga (Free, in-app purchases available) 1.124 billion downloads Skype is a fallen giant. With the release of Windows 11, Skype is no longer pre-installed on the operating system for the first time in more than a decade. The business branch is shuttered from August 2021, and it appears that Microsoft Teams is now the company's focus. Expect it to drop out of the top 20 in 2022. Download: Skype (Free) 1.081 billion downloads It's perhaps surprising that it has taken until 2021 for Spotify to make the top 20. It is yet another company that has benefitted enormously from the COVID pandemic, with paid users jumping from 130 million to 160 million over the last 12 months. Indeed, the number has more than doubled since early 2017. It has 360 million users in total. Download: Spotify (Free, subscription available) 1.025 billion downloads Dropbox is one of the best-known cloud storage services around. It lets you store documents in the cloud, access them from anywhere, and share them with other users. Download: Dropbox (Free, subscription available) 909 million downloads Viber offers instant messaging, video calls, 250-person group chats, and encrypted communications. The app is one of the most popular WhatsApp alternatives in Europe and North America. Asian users still prefer LINE. It is the first app on the list that hasn't yet broken the one billion downloads mark. Download: Viber (Free, in-app purchases available) 874 million downloads LINE is the fourth-most popular instant messaging app on Android, behind WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Viber. Asia drives much of its popularity. It's in the top five communications apps in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Cambodia, and Indonesia. The app struggles to make the top 30 in most European and North American countries, however. Download: LINE (Free, in-app purchases available) So what have we learned from this tour through the 20 most popular Android apps as of July 2021? Our conclusions are thus: So now you know what the most popular Android apps are. Do you have them all installed on your smartphone? These Android apps are extremely popular, but they also compromise your security and privacy. If you have them installed, you'll want to uninstall them after reading this.

Learn more By Brian Turner last updated 11 days ago Develop apps for your own business The best mobile app development software makes it simple and easy to develop apps specific to your own business. This is important because while mobile apps may have been traditionally associated with information and gaming, business apps are now an essential part for many everyday business operations. This is underlined by the easy availability of smartphones and BYOD (Bring You Own Device) work policies with MDM (Mobile Device Management) solutions in place, which means that employees can now use their iPhones or Android phones for general business process, covering everything from productivity apps to collaborative software apps.  The technology continues to develop, with the increasing availability of augmentation and machine-learning options to provide additional layers of information and communications into your digital services. Whether for marketing services, retail, product development and deployment, as well as Software as a Service (SaaS), app development has come of age. The market reflects this, with a huge number of companies out there that will offer to design and code apps, not just for iOS or Android, but also smart TV's, game consoles, and other hardware, as well as software solutions.  However, there are also software development platforms available to create white label apps from basic templates and configurations. These aim to make it easy for businesses to create their own in-house apps as required, or even create apps for the open market. Here we'll feature the best mobile app development software platforms. We've also highlighted the best laptops for programming.  Appy Pie is a software platform that allows you to develop your own apps without having to do any coding. There are a number of options and tools provided that are easy to use to create the app that you need. The process is relatively simple, and involves selecting a design and personalizing it, adding the features that you need, then publishing to Google Play and the Apple AppStore. The interface used is a simple drag-and-drop system that allows you to add features such as chatbots, AI, augmented or virtual reality. To help with development, a learning platform and suite of training videos are provided to help guide you. The app you create can be for almost any business need, such as for a small business, restaurant, real estate, or even a radio app. Once you've developed your app, there are options to distribute it to the Google Play and Apple App stores.   Zoho Creator is a multi-platform app builder that allows you to create a new app or use a ready-made one. The software is especially aimed at businesses looking to simplify and automate tasks, such as creating apps for functions such as sales management, order management, event management, logistics, or recruitment tracking, for example. However, whatever you're looking to do, you can entirely customize it the way you want. Zoho Creator includes a drag-and-drop editor to help build you app from within a single dashboard. While initially targeted at businesses looking to develop apps for specific needs within their company, Zoho Creator can also be used to develop apps for the wider market.  Even better, you can integrate data from other apps, increasing its usability. Potential integrations include other Zoho apps, Paypal, Twilio, Google Workspace, and Quickbooks.   AppSheet is another platform that allows you to create bespoke apps for your business, without having to write with or develop code. Driven by your own cloud-hosted data in spreadsheet format, you can then select a template to work around the options and features you want, before deploying your app. It's easy to integrate data from multiple sources, not least from Google Sheets and Forms, Excel from Microsoft 365, or even SalesForce. Alternatively, you can import spreadsheets saved on Dropbox or OneDrive, or directly from MySQL or SQL Server.  On top of these you can add features such as GPS and maps, image capture, code scanning, signature capture, charts, and email notifications. There's no charge for developing your app, or time limit, and up to ten users can be involved in the process. Once deployed, pricing is according to per active user per month.   Appian promote the development of \"low code\" apps which they advertise as taking as little as eight weeks between developing the idea and completing the app. The main focus of Appian's app development software is enterprise apps for business, to optimize processes using automotive processes and AI, in order to present company data in useful and meaningful ways.  Additionally, by orchestrating data from multiple sources, information can be unified to provide real opportunities for insights on everything to management processes to workflows to operations. The development process itself involves using a visual editor, to select desired functions and how data is to be routed through these. The aim is to allow for complex options to be set up in a simple way, so that data can be intelligently managed. Once completed, the design can be saved as a web app or native app for Android and iOS as required. Further changes can be made on the fly without causing downtime.   Appery is an established app development provider, offering its app builder platform for enterprises to create their own apps. Creating an app is as easy as using a drag-and-drop interface, and selecting data sources as well as using HTML 5 and Javascript as required. The aim is to jump start app development for a faster and cheaper development process. The process can take as little as a week during which time Appery will set up installation, configuration, integration, testing, and training for its completion. In addition to increased turnaround time, Appery also allows for a focus on extensibility, so that the same apps can be modified easily and without requiring significant development time. Built on an open platform, Appery allows for multiple apps to be developed from the same base according to needs, in order to reduce the need for replication in evolving apps. By also ensuring that configurations can be changed rather than be dependent on pre-existing settings, it allows for the flexible development of apps according to enterprise needs. There are no flat fees advertised at Appery, so you will need to contact the company for more information on a quote. We've also featured the best apps for small business.

Platform: The primary emphasis of any app development falls on the concept and idea of the app. However, the type of platform selected to develop the app is equivalently essential. Businesses must opt for a mobile app development platform that resonates with their previous apps as well as future proposals. The mobile app development platform can determine the base cost of the app. For instance, the app development cost for the iOS platform is relatively costlier than the Android or Hybrid platform.  2. App Size: The size of the app plays a significant role in finalizing the mobile app development cost. The number of screens required in the app along with its backend functionalities such as databases, user management portals, storage, etc. is reviewed to assess the app development cost. Extensive storage, multiple screens, and complex backend features can raise the overall price of the app. However, if data storage is required in the future, it is advisable to build data compression during the development phase to avoid unnecessary upgrades and charges in the long term.  3. Plugins and Integrations: In this era, most apps offer third-party data integrations and plugins to enhance the user experience. The most common plugins incorporated in the apps are social media extensions. For these integrations to work flawlessly, app developers need to formulate an advanced Application Programming Interface (API). API consists of a set of routines, tools, and protocols that allows the interaction of the application with other devices. Installing APIs will supplement the app development cost. 4. Security: Data security is crucial in the digital age. Nevertheless, the level of encryption required by each app varies based on its type and functionality. If an app gathers the personal data of the user or facilitates payment gateways, a very high level of app encryption is essential. It is advisable to discuss the type of data security required for the app in the initial stages as the later addition of data encryption could cost significantly more. The time and money invested in developing a mobile app chiefly depend on its complexity. A recent survey by GoodFirms on the mobile app development cost and time survey highlights the following findings: Cost:  Time:  It is critical to thoroughly research each and every company to find the best one out. Below are a few points you must consider when hiring mobile app developers for your dream app development project whether it is for iOS, Android or any other platform: 1. Portfolio: A companies portfolio provides you insight within the working pattern and the type of projects the top app developers have curated. It also highlights their strengths and weaknesses allowing you to consider their candidature. A portfolio also emphasizes on their proven records in various industries, allowing you to assess and hire mobile app developers having experience relevant to your project. 2. Client Reviews: Nowadays it is indispensable for all businesses to gather client feedback and publish reviews. Reading testimonials and online recommendations about the app developers’ work as social proof. Authentic positive reviews will provide you with great confidence in making the decision of selecting the right mobile app development company for your android app development or ios app development project. 3. Team: Researching the mobile development team working for the mobile app design & development company is beneficial as they are going to work on your smartphone app project. Check the Linkedin profile of executives, project managers, tech leads, etc. and hire mobile app developers after evaluating their talent, experience, and past mobile application development projects. 4. Cost: Customarily, the cost of an entire mobile app development project is based on the features integrated into the app, its scope for scalability, and its complexity. Another determining factor is the time taken to develop the application. Experienced app developers may offer rapid deployment of an app at a higher cost whereas, inexperienced app development agencies may require multiple revisions thereby costing you nearly the same while taking longer time-span. 5. Meeting with CEO: It is important to understand the vision and values of an organization and the best person you must contact for this is the CEO of the mobile app design & development company. Visions, values, and culture of the company matter a lot, especially if you are going to partner with them for long term mobile application development projects. Out of the numerous mobile app agencies, several seem eligible contenders to work on your dream project. However, only a handful may fit suit to a fraction! The question is how to identify whether a company is getting its money’s worth? So before you take the plunge into mobile app development services, present certain inquiries to the shortlisted app development agencies to ensure you receive the desired results. 1. Can You Exhibit Few Samples of Your Previous Work? It is vital to check out apps previously developed by the shortlisted mobile app development companies to analyze their performance. To check the authenticity of the company, you may ask them to provide you the link of their apps on popular app stores. You can further inquire about having a demo of such apps to assess whether the quality delivered by the app developers aligns with your demands. Finally, opt for an app development company having industry-specific experience, so that they promptly understand the niche of your business and the requirements of your target audience. 2. Can You Provide a Reference List of Previous Clients? This reference list will offer you an impartial and independent insight into the workings and caliber of the company. You must also check out independent research and review platforms, such as GoodFirms, to further determine the quality of the mobile app development services. These autonomous platforms rank companies after examining genuine feedback and client recommendations.  3. Are Testing Services Included in the Package? Coding is a major part of app development. Whereas, another crucial component is testing itself. Mobile app testing verifies the behavior of the app across various devices. The best mobile app developers track the features of the app to ensure its functionality and fix any errors that may present itself. Certain app development agencies provide app testing services at an added cost.  4. Do You Offer App Designing Services? Although the functionalities and features of the app are the driving factors of the app's operation, cut-throat competition requires apps to be aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. The users tend to abandon apps having complicated navigational attributes and bland designs. Some app developers can offer fundamental designing solutions, while others may have a partnership with external app designing firms. However, companies can opt for top mobile app design companies to design a responsive mobile app and deliver an unmatched user experience. 5. Do You Offer Post-Launch Support? No matter how accurately an app is curated, a glitch can occasionally render the app futile. It is imperative that the best mobile app developers offer app support and maintenance post-deployment. You must inquire whether they assist during revision and addition of new features and functionalities. Furthermore, determine how they tackle potential bugs. Also, do not forget to ask about the costs of each new release and bug fixes, as these services are charged separately.  To devise the perfect mobile application, company proprietors must find the best mobile app development company.

        "body": "The investments firms are making in mobile apps are starting to pay off, but the financial advice industry still has a long way to go. Three-quarters of wealth management firms made feature enhancements to their apps over the past year, up from 44% in 2020, according to J.D. Power. As a result, overall customer satisfaction surged nine points from last year (scoring 858 on a 1,000-point scale), and the number of customers using their wealth apps daily increased four percentage points. Customers who use their apps multiple times per day increased three percentage points. U.S. Bancorp Investments ranked the highest with a score of 884, followed by Chase Mobile (876) and Merrill Edge (870). TD Ameritrade Mobile scored the lowest with 838. However, wealth management still trails the industry average scores earned by banking (860), credit cards (867) and insurance apps (877). Other sectors of financial services are simply developing quicker — 33% of credit card apps and 50% of banking apps made “major feature updates” this year compared to 31% of wealth apps. “Clearly, the investment that firms have put behind their digital strategies is having a positive effect on app user experience and overall utilization rates, but that same thing is happening everywhere, and some industries are just moving faster,” Michael Foy, senior director of wealth intelligence at J.D. Power, said in a statement. While most firms’ apps are good at providing market-related news and information, many fall short when it comes to delivering personalized content and guidance, which was a significant theme of Financial Planning’s recent INVEST Connect conference. Just 51% of customers strongly agree that their wealth app provides tailored insights and content. Firms can also improve the user experience, with only 47% saying it’s “very easy” to research investment options on their wealth app. “Wealth management firms have some unique challenges because of legacy back-end technology and the sheer complexity and range of services they need to provide,” Foy said. While attachment to legacy systems is certainly an issue for some firms, others have only just started to feel pressure from clients to modernize their technology, said Ronnie Colvin, founder of French Press Financial Services, an RIA based out of Reno, Nevada. But with the pandemic forcing many clients and advisors to finally embrace technology, supporting mobile access is more of a priority than ever.  “In a nutshell, wealth management firms are behind on technology because their client base hasn't been demanding it until recently, so they saw no reason to invest the time and money,” Colvin said.  However, wealth firms do have unique opportunities to improve their apps in ways that other financial services firms cannot, Foy said. They could facilitate communication and engagement between clients and their human advisors. Currently, only 44% of those who use a wealth app and work with an advisor say they can communicate with their advisor through the app. That number is unchanged since J.D. Power’s 2020 study. “The key for wealth management firms to level up in this competitive environment is to heavily lean into their unique value propositions, making it easy and intuitive for investors to move seamlessly between the app and other digital or human channels while delivering personalized guidance and important information along the way,” said Amit Aggarwal, J.D. Power’s senior director of digital solutions, in a statement. J.D. Power’s wealth management mobile app satisfaction study is based on responses from 3,025 full-service and self-directed investors. The study evaluates apps based on five criteria: range of services, clarity of information, ease of navigating, appearance and speed of load times. Scroll down to see how J.D. Power ranked the apps."

Take care of your present moment, and the future falls into place on its own. So revamp your business with some of the coolest and never before mobile app ideas, we have in store for you.  “Mobile app ideas are those innovative business plans that can be implemented and operated through a mobile app. It could be a product, a service, or even a utility.“   Well, it’s been a challenging task to put down the first idea. Because priorities change from person to person. But we came to the understanding that food excites everyone. Well, hunger at least is something we all agree upon without much ado. And nothing satisfies you like a delicious homely preparation. So here is the first trending mobile app idea for you: An app that serves those with a craving for specific homely dishes and wants it prepared at their home. The app will include the list of verified home chef’s who are experts in particular dishes. Users can rate the chefs and make a list of the most loved chefs for different dishes. The app will be suitable for urban customers who are missing their home. The app can integrate booking the chef, sharing location to the user, and providing a route map to the chef to locate the user’s apartment. The app will better fit the ios app store as the target customers are likely to be well off and from developed countries.  If you are thinking, isn’t it too late to start an ecommerce business, let me tell you, it’s never too late. Although the ecommerce market is loaded with business ideas and almost every segment has an ecommerce presence by now, if you have a unique idea, the stage is yours. A positive aspect of the ecommerce business is that there is no limit to potential buyers. So if you can offer something that no one else can, you are sure to succeed.  It is important to find a niche and build around it. For example, in today’s times, where the Internet of Things is very popular, an ecommerce platform that sells smart home products will have great value. Similarly, as people move towards a sustainable lifestyle, they are open to the idea of reusing second-hand products. If you venture into ecommerce app development with such unique and pertinent ideas, you can make it big in the field.  Most of us have fallen into the following scenarios at least once. We hear a song, we like it, but unfortunately, we forget the lyrics, and all we have is the humming part or a fragment of the song.  Otherwise, some lyrics come to us suddenly, and we don’t know which song it is. In both cases, we steam our memory to find out the music. So won’t it be an excellent idea for a mobile app? An app to find out the song from a few lyrics or from the humming. It will be even better if you can sing the portion you know, and the app can find out the song and the singer.   A mobile app idea that has taken off with the onset of coronavirus is grocery delivery apps. While we saw big companies like Amazon start grocery delivery, we also witnessed the move of several local brick and mortar stores to online platforms. It guarantees one thing- there is a vast market out there for you to sell. Specialize in selling organic/natural grocery products, or focus on selling frozen foods. So fix an idea and start your grocery app development.   Those who have kids at home know how much space the toys take. And the kids, as they grow, interests change quickly, and soon the house will be flooded with a lot of toys. The next mobile app idea is to develop a platform where the parents can sell old toys or even exchange them with others. Exchanging can be a better idea, as your kid will be happy with the new toy and won’t mind losing the old one. It can save the parents from the hassle of storing old toys and save their money without buying brand new toys.    We all plan long dreamy trips. But when the time comes, we are all stuck. An intelligent travel planner can make a difference, though. The Travel Plan app idea gives a new dimension to the traditional traveller apps. It lets the user sync their office schedule with the app. It is possible with the Google MyAnalytics and other Office 365 tools. The app will collect data inputs on your favourite destinations. It will use your preferences and the schedule to match your common vacations to give you the best trip date. It will use BigData analysis to capture the opening time, the best time, and the essential places to visit for you and fit them all into your trip chart.  Since the inception of Uber, taxi app services have been in demand. By 2024, 1588 million people are expected to use online taxi services. Although it requires a certain amount of investment, the good news is that within a financial year, you can double the amount of your investment. The success of the app depends on the quality of services you offer. If you can assure good quality service, taxi app development is a promising field to enter into.   Gone are the days when people give a second thought before performing online transactions. Today, buying and selling things online have become very common. The popularity of classified apps like OLX, Quikr, eBay, etc., are proof of the same. Classified apps are more versatile than ecommerce apps and have better reach. Whether you have products you want to sell or want to help people find the perfect buyer/seller or have some marketing purpose, classified app development will have you covered.  Most of us would have ended up using things past their expiry date at least once. People often forget to track down the expiry date and keep on using the same product. It is an app idea with real practical use for everyone. So if we have an app to track down the expiry date of perishables, you can save your stomach from a disaster.   You are moving to a new flat or thinking about redecorating your house and have no idea about the interior design part. So why not develop an app for it. An Augmented Reality (AR) based app can give a 3 Dimensional model of how your house will look with the furniture and other designs. The app can solve interior design issues. Other features, like color suggestions, can also be included in the app.   Food delivery apps are not a new idea. It has been some years since they have made an entry into people’s everyday lives. But Covid-19 accelerated the growth of food delivery apps. So this is the right time to venture into food delivery app development with some innovative ideas. For example, an app that uses augmented reality to create interactive menu cards so that people can make better choices about what to order. This would add an extra dimension to your food delivery app and attract more customers.   Cities are magnets that attract people. Developed or developing the city is a space of very high population density. It makes space the most valuable asset in a town. We have brought you an app idea for finding a parking space in the city. It will have some prerequisites like setting up parking spaces, identifying the peak hours, congestion areas, etc. The app can leverage GPS and traffic analysis data from Google and associated services to pinpoint and suggest the most appropriate parking lots. The app can, besides, suggest parking early in the days of festivals, unusual events, accidents, or special events. This mobile app idea can indeed leverage the latest mobile app trends to win many hearts.  After the end of the school year, all the students will be left with their old books and tools. Some of these might not be of any need in the future.  Especially when there is a change of stream, there will be many school supplies left with the students. If there is an arrangement to collect old books and other tools like geometry boxes, other students can use them.  If an engineer can create a successful mobile application to collect these school supplies and give them to the student in need, it would be a significant venture.  It is the era where people make a lot of new year resolutions and do not follow them. People make many good decisions like learning new things, reading books, traveling around, or staying healthy. But these decisions don’t even last a month.  But things can be a little different if you get the constant motivation to fulfill the wishes. It is human nature to get inspired when someone motivates you daily. A mobile app is an ideal choice. If your app continually reminds you about the target, people will put in the effort. There can also be features to set intermediate goals. It will be a good idea if there are some appreciation messages too if they reach the goal.  Digital healthcare services have made the lives of doctors, patients, and healthcare providers easier. Doctor appointment apps are a useful mobile app idea that can help save time and effort for all parties involved. It can be an application that lets patients book appointments themselves or through a provider. Such booking apps save patients the trouble of travelling long distances and waiting in long queues. Doctor appointment app development is on the rise, and now is the right time to invest in one.   Our ancestors have walked this earth for over 6 million years. Hence, the nature of the solutions they found to illness vary from place to place. Today people travel a lot outside their hometown. Thus, the raw materials for those age-old Granny remedies may not be available to you always. Hence, the app idea to make a standalone healthcare app solve the problem. We propose an app that has a repository of all the home remedies — mainly classified on the geographical and cultural lines. The current location details will sort out the kind of medication the user can try out. There is also a need to classify remedies based on symptoms and illness. One can also add “call the doctor,” as a last resort.   The economy is going completely digital, and cashless transactions are the new normal. Several online payment apps have already won the hearts of people. But there is scope for more. If you can develop a payment wallet app with unique features and safe services, there is a great chance that it will make a big mark. Just think of how people have adopted Google Pay recently and how it has become a normal mode of money transfer now! If you have any idea on those lines, now is the time to act!  It can interest the music enthusiasts, and undoubtedly the number is significant. The music a person listens to depends on their mood. The kind of music a person plays when working will be different from party music.  The music depends on the person’s mood and the kind of activity they are doing. So why not an app to identify the spirit of the user and give them the desirable music.  The same can be done for movies too. If an app can suggest movies according to the user’s mood, they can avoid choosing movies from a big list starting from the genre.  In the past decade, we have seen the travel and tourism industry flourish. The period also marked the boom of mobile apps. So naturally, it led to the development of mobile applications for facilitating travel-related activities. An app idea that is much in demand and has a constant market is the flight booking app. To be able to book a flight at their convenience and not have to wait at a travel agency makes things very easy for people. If you can add some extra features, like weather forecast and rewards and develop a flight booking app, it has great potential.  There are usual sets of items that magically go missing like keys, spectacles, or tv remotes, especially when you are in a hurry. We spend a lot of time finding those.  Why not develop an app to find out these essential items. We can list the items on the app, and when it goes missing, the app can help you find those items.  With the help of IoT and Artificial Intelligence, the app can be practical. It can be of great use to everyone despite age.  Digitization is transforming every industry, and healthcare is on top of the list. There are several mobile app ideas related to this sector. Medical record tracking apps, fitness apps, wellness apps, remote monitoring apps- opportunities are endless! Recently, with the outbreak of Covid, telemedicine apps are rising in demand. It provides online consultation, making healthcare more accessible and wide-reaching. Healthcare app development has a promising future and will be a worthy investment!    A social-media like app exclusively for book lovers. Not all book lovers are wealthy, and libraries are so far and rare. Especially in the countryside and villages. This mobile app idea can make the day for book lovers. It is a sharing platform for readers who are happy to collect and share books. The users will register apps by declaring the books both online and offline they possess. The app allows readers from the location to chat, arrange meetings, conduct literary meets, etc. The app allows readers to make an online repository of e-books and facilitate the exchange of printed books. Apple better supports such utility-specific apps, as iOS app development integrates a classic touch always.  When someone is relocating or redecorating their houses, there will be a lot of stuff that goes into the trash, mostly because these things cannot be accommodated in the house. So there is an app idea, a platform to give away your used products online. It can be furniture, gadgets, or even clothes. You can give it away to charity or any other people in need.  People are no longer sticking to old school technologies to increase their business. Instead, they are finding new ways to reach out to customers. Salon apps are a great example of the same. We all need to avail salon services at least once every month. But in our busy lifestyle, it may not always be possible or easy. Salon app development creates a perfect solution for this problem. When people can access salon services at their fingertips, imagine the ease they would experience and the sales it would bring to the business!   We know how embarrassing it is when the phone rings while an important meeting is going on or in a religious place. It is not intentional; people forget to make them silent. So here is an app idea to avoid those situations. If the app can track the user’s location and automatically change to silent mode, it can be helpful. So while you are in a religious place or educational institution, you don’t have to worry about turning the phone silent.  Do you own a restaurant and are having a tough time finding some business with the onset of food delivery apps and the like? Or do you want a simple way to manage your restaurant business? Mobile apps can come to your rescue. Integrate a food ordering/delivery app to your restaurant business and increase sales tenfold. Or develop a restaurant managing app that allows customers to book tables and pay bills and restaurant staff to receive orders. Restaurant app development can help you stay ahead of your competitors and improve your business.   A great idea needs greater support. It requires the right nourishment and the resources to actualize it. Our sixth mobile app idea is to save ideas from pitiful demise. In this app idea, every user can create a profile and share their thoughts. It will require some minimum benchmark to give optimum visibility to provide the deserving idea of greater visibility. Collaboration from the investor side will be essential before developing the app. A proper user interface to make investors find ideas they are looking for will be vital in making it successful. The classification of ideas based on the industry is one way of creating an interface. This app can spur a creativity revolution like never before, a place where idea meets investors.  Another mobile app idea is for a social cause. Most might have wondered what the restaurants or caterers do with their extra food. It is probably wasted or going unused. What if we can feed the needy? What if someone can design an app to make use of these extra foods? An app that guides the restaurant or caterers to find out people who have no food to eat.  There are thousands of people who don’t have enough food to eat; many are there who can manage only one meal a day. So if a mobile app can help few people survive, won’t that be great.  App ideas emerge when needs emerge. As on-demand services are gaining more visibility and appreciation, it is the best time to introduce creative ideas in the on-demand sector. Creative ideas don’t have to be out of the ordinary. The best ideas are the ones that can make people’s everyday lives simpler, like laundry app development. In the busy everyday life, who wouldn’t love to have their laundry taken care of, right? By developing a laundry app that will pick up laundry and return cleaned clothes, your app will be doing a valuable service to many!  In the current pandemic time, the classes are conducted online. So there is no provision for students to sit and study together. An app to create virtual study rooms where the students can exchange their notes or talk about the lessons they have learned. It can be beneficial for every student, especially those who are reluctant to ask questions to their teachers.  If you own a car, you know car washing can be a headache. Every week or two, a car needs a good wash. A car owner either washes the car at their home or takes their car to a car wash centre. Both of these take time and cannot always be done at their convenience. So what about you develop a car wash app that will let customers schedule car washes from their smartphone itself? If you can provide some customized features and great service, it’s sure to be a hit!   We live in a world where talented people are looking for an opening and they can’t find it. Education is undergoing a substantial transformation with the evolution of mobile technology. Today, companies know that individual talent and skills always surpass certifications and formal recommendations. Creativity is the sizzling spirit in the informal ordinary being, formalism always unknowingly kills it. Bill Gates, Albert Einstein, Rabindranath Tagore and many more are examples of those who stood out because they refused to be conditioned by a formal “one-size-fits-all” schooling approach. This app will suit such dynamic and vibrant individuals. They may be seeking a trainer, a skilled specialist. The others may be looking forward to sharing their skills. The app will showcase the master trainers from various fields and the user can connect with them and arrange classes. The app will enhance the employment and skills simultaneously.   Color blindness is a common disability. People with these issues find it difficult to distinguish colors, mostly red and green. And we know how important red and green is, the traffic signals, grocery shopping, choosing clothes can go difficult.  An app to recognize the color blinds. They might often find it embarrassing to ask people around for help. If an app can help them identify the colors, it can help them overcome their disability significantly. It is one of the best mobile app ideas on the list.  An app that delivers fuel- sounds handy, right? We all might have gone through situations where we got stuck during a journey due to running out of fuel. It is a frustrating situation to be in! If you were urgently going somewhere, it could ruin all your plans because finding the nearest fuel outlet and refilling the fuel tank is an arduous task. Fuel delivery apps give an easy solution to take care of this. It enables people to use their smartphones to arrange fuel delivery at whichever location they desire. It is a market with a large potential and not much competition, so fuel delivery app development is a great idea if you have the interest.  This app idea can help you figure out the freshness of fruits and vegetables. When you are in a supermarket for daily shopping, you can use the app to check items’ freshness. The app can also have features to predict how long the thing will stay fresh. The app can be beneficial to people who have started living independently or for people who haven’t done grocery shopping.  Digital readers are growing in number. Being able to get hands on tons of information with a simple Google search has transformed many of us into online readers. The introduction of ebooks, and online newspapers, has further fueled digital reading. Investing in this trend, an innovative mobile app idea is a digital magazine app. It will help readers access magazines on their devices while helping the magazine creators reach a wider audience. You can go creative with what type of magazine you want to launch. It could be comics, journals, current affairs- the possibilities are many!    We live in a world where organic is the trend. But most people use even organic products with an internal conflict. They simply don’t know how it was made? This app idea will create a friendly partnership with the farmer and the seekers of health. The greatest reason farmers switch to artificial means is the cost and difficulty in producing organically. And the solution is to let the fund and the farmers meet.  Our mobile app concept proposes – own a farmer scheme. The app allows interested users to form a group or act individually. The individuals or groups will then connect with the registered farmers. The farmer will be displayed based on the items he cultivates.  Once connected the app allows access to the farmer’s field with strategically placed CCTV cameras. Round the clock access to area ensures trust and satisfaction. The funds will be transferred beforehand to enable farmers to get resources. The farmer may either choose to keep the money or a part of the produce. There are many top mobile app development frameworks available to execute the app concept into reality.  We all have that important day on which we need everything to be perfect. It can be an interview, a business meeting, or a seminar. People get excited or nervous. They often tend to forget certain essential things. If an app can predict all the possible disasters that can happen on the day, people can get prepared. For example, if there is heavy traffic, you can get late or forget your laptop. All these predictions can help you prepare better. It can be another add on to the trending app ideas of 2021.  Field sales is one of the most effective and tried and tested approaches for marketing. But it is not an easy field. A field salesperson may often have too many things on hand, which tends to affect their productivity and peace of mind. So what about a mobile app idea that makes their days easier? These can be daily target apps, where field sales agents can record and update their targets, order management apps where they can manage their daily order and ensure deliveries or agent tracking apps that enable agents to cover their entire assigned area easily. Field sales app development definitely has a good market and a promising future.  You open all your food delivery apps and keep searching for food and finally end up ordering the same old food from the same old restaurant. We have all been in the above situation. How about an app where people can find out the kind of food they want to eat. The kind of food depends on your mood. It can be super spicy biryani at times or maybe cheesy pizza. If an app can identify the kind of food you want and then all you need is to search for that food. It can save a lot of time and effort.  The logistics industry is growing tremendously and can hugely benefit from digital services. Good communication, ease of transportation, and assurity of delivery are three main aspects required for a logistics service. And what better way to implement them than via mobile apps? Some great ideas for logistics app development are logistics tracking apps that take care of consignments, management apps to delegate parcel services to drivers, and booking apps for vehicles.   United Nations is pitching up the need to go green in its UNFCCC forum to save the earth. And every one of us owes it to this beautiful green planet. And thus our 9th mobile app idea is dedicated to earth. Now, the app concept involves syncing your green energy grid and your conventional power supply to generate usage data. The app helps the user to get the amount of power available at his solar cell pool or wind energy, etc. The app will suggest a green target depending upon the user’s available renewable energy storage capacity. The app can integrate power electronic switching tools to allow switching between green and conventional power. You can work more upon the idea with the assistance of other power experts.  Huge offers on big brands often make us doubt the authenticity of the product. It is not easy to find out if the product is original or the first copy. Here is an app idea, to find out the authenticity of the product. The app helps you find out if the product is original and is from the claimed brand.  Other features, like brand information, can be included. If you can scan the brand name or the logo, you get more information about the brand.  Event management is something that has risen to huge popularity in recent years. Today, most events-big or small, employ an event management service to conduct events successfully. Doesn’t an app that helps them organize better and do their job more effectively sound like a good idea? The app can let them plan everything to the t, collaborate better, and coordinate every task most efficiently. As new event management companies are emerging and it is becoming a mainstream profession, building an event management app can add incredible value to the companies.  All of us have our times in a day. There are night owls and early birds. Our work depends on our mood too. The most important things are to be done when you are in your best mood. The coming mobile app idea is to find out your mood changes in a day. When is it that people feel the best and worst? According to the output, people can plan their day. It can make every day more productive and enjoyable.  One of the biggest challenges of the logistics industry is managing the truck fleet. Checking the availability of trucks, ensuring their arrival, departure, running status, and managing consignments- it’s a difficult task. A mobile app can greatly simplify things. It can save a lot of time and hassle. A simple app can be used to list all the trucks and their status so that all the required information is available at a glance. Developing a truck booking app to facilitate better transportation services is also a great mobile app idea!   The role of citizens in pollution control is paramount. Our next app idea is a tool that makes every individual conscious of the carbon footprint they are leaving behind. And it is based on Augmented Reality (AR) and machine learning. Before we move ahead, a few words on the carbon footprint for the newbies. It is the amount of carbon that we release into the environment as individuals, community or as companies. The app idea involves a scanner that needs the user’s fingertip assistance. Suppose you are burning coal for fuel (a hypothetical situation). You want to know the amount of carbon footprint it leaves behind. You can circle the activity on your screen to aid the scanner to identify the action. Activities that are unknown to the app database will need your assistance. The app will be self-learning and over the course of the month will generate a daily, weekly and monthly chart. It will also suggest the necessary changes in behavior, habits, etc. make your life more eco-friendly.  You must have heard about the famous dabbawalas of Mumbai. Dressed in a white outfit and Gandhi cap and delivering lunches to thousands of offices throughout Mumbai, they have received even international acclaim. The next mobile app idea we have for you is inspired by these dabbawalas. Imagine an app that will help you get homemade lunch delivered to your office! You are already rooting for it, right? It will be a great app idea that will attract several customers.  The idea is pretty different. You often find apps that help you to plan your trip. But what if there are places you would like to avoid. For example, areas where there is a lot of robbery or social issues. Or even the food that you should not eat, maybe because you are allergic to something or can give you a sour stomach. An app to tell you about the places you should not go to and what food not to eat. It can be a problem when you visit sites whose local language is unknown to you. The app can help you avoid undesirable situations.   What if you want to try a new restaurant, you don’t have a company. Eating alone is not everyone’s cup of tea. So what do you do now? An app to find your food buddy. A platform for people with common food interests, they can connect on the app and hang out.  Food is an emotion that holds people together; we have seen how successful restaurant app development has become. Food-related app ideas can be a big hit.   Who doesn’t like shopping? But what if you can get to try on the products for real. The app will use Augmented Reality (AR) to optimize the user experience. The concept is to make an online e-commerce application with things that you can try on. The store can have multiple sections like, gadgets, ornaments, make-up, clothes, watches and anything that a customer needs to try own before a purchase. Once the customer selects the products, it will qualify for charged or free delivery as you intend to operate.   With the arrival of millennials and gen Zs in the workforce, flexible work culture started to gain prominence. And with COVID 19 rewriting the way offices operate, the traditional office setup is also adapting to flexible work. In this scenario, an app that provides a medium for people to find flexible work would be ideal. The app can act as a platform where employers share the requirement for the skills they need, along with the period of hiring and details. Interested candidates can connect with them through the app. This can be beneficial for both parties. The new generation doesn’t want to be tied to a single job or a strict work schedule. Flexible work opportunities can satisfy their creative needs while also giving them the safety of work and versatility in carrying it out. For employers, this will provide a platform where they can hire based on demand. The need for varied skills is increasing day by day, especially in industries such as IT. Recruiting full-time employees for all the requirements would be costly and challenging to manage. Flexible work can be advantageous in situations like this.  Further, it can also be beneficial for students, remote workers, etc. who need fluidity in their work schedule.   If you are a sports fanatic, this idea must have definitely crossed your mind. Especially with the recent boom in fantasy sports with apps like Dream 11, sports app development is in the limelight. The great news about fantasy sports is that demand is plenty, and players aren’t many. So it’s definitely an idea worth giving some thought. Or, if you aren’t interested in fantasy sports, think of apps that provide online sports training. With the growing number of people interested in sports, it will be an app idea worth executing!   Readers have a never ending list of books to read. They are always confused when it comes to picking their next read. Mostly, they make the choice based on book reviews. However, it’s not easy to find credible reviews. Our next app idea is to help readers find book reviews easily. An app that helps people upload a picture of a book cover and use it to find reviews. Interesting, right? The app would fetch reviews from established platforms like Amazon, LibraryThing, Goodreads, etc. Users can compare reviews from multiple sites in the app and use it to make an informed decision on whether to buy or read the book!   Famous German-American writer Charles Bukowski said, “When I am feeling low, all I have to do is watch my cats and my courage returns.” All through the years, pets have been a favourite companion of humans. Pets are found to reduce mental illnesses such as stress, anxiety, increase happiness, and improve physical health. Keeping their pets healthy and playful is something every pet owner wants. Our next app idea is about fitness for pets. It can track the pet’s activity and exercises, analyze it and create a report. This can be helpful if you are going to a vet. It can also help you choose pet products or services based on pet’s activity. The app can also provide notifications and reminders to pet owners such as buying food, or time for walking, etc. It can notify the owner if the pet activity is abnormal so that they can get a heads up and give proper care to the pets. Our understanding is that ideas operate like a chain reaction. One thought triggers another idea and so on. So, utilize our mobile app ideas or have it trigger your imagination for new ideas.

        "body": "Driven by the change in human behavior worldwide, having a mobile presence has become imperative for a business’s survival. As mobility continues to transform industries globally, mobile-first companies are capturing the imagination of the ever-increasing mobile society. However, merely breaking into the mobile market does not necessarily translate into success for a business. To succeed in a highly competitive mobile marketplace, it takes in-depth research, strategy building, extensive planning, and assessing the current mobile ecosystem for enterprises with either an existing mobile app or those planning to build a new mobile application. Although native apps offer an unmatched experience in terms of aesthetics and functionality, native apps are costly to build and maintain. The diversity of devices and platforms makes maximum user penetration challenging with native apps. The solution lies in creating a web, hybrid, or cross-platform mobile app for businesses with budget constraints by leveraging mobile app development frameworks. Modern mobile app development frameworks offer many in-built advantages, such as a quick development process, efficiency, full-proof environment, etc. The framework renders the app for the desired platform with the developer’s code using pre-built components such as compilers, debuggers, toolsets, coding interfaces, etc. The App Annie State of Mobile 2021 report informs that Generation Z, Millenials, and Baby Boomers spend 16%, 18%, and 30% more time year-on-year, respectively, on their favorite apps. Post the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, mobile adoption witnessed a boom in 2020, advancing by 2-3 years in 12 months. For the first time, mobile time spent surpassed TV. While the average American spent 3.7 hours watching TV a day, they spent 4 hours a day on their mobile device in H2 2020. According to a report from Statista, as 2021 dawned upon us, the number of global mobile users crossed the 7 billion mark. In the new reality, Digital Transformation has assumed greater significance. The users have exceptionally high standards in terms of functionality and performance when it comes to mobile applications. Therefore, a mobile app’s success translates into adapting digital content to transcend seamlessly across varying screen sizes and a broad range of devices encompassing Android and iOS platforms. Obtaining the services of a reliable mobile app development company or hiring a mobile app developer on a freelance basis can enable a business to build mobile apps that are fast, responsive, and deliver exceptional user experiences. Leveraging mobile app development frameworks makes the mobile app development process efficient and fast.

Mockplus Cloud - Collaboration and design handoff for product teams Selecting a good font is crucial for UI/UX designers to create a successful mobile app. However, do you know why it is necessary? Here are the main reasons: The text in every design helps the users understand the features and interact with your mobile apps smoothly. A clear and neat font simplifies the process and increases the readability and legibility of your mobile pages.  A good font can make your mobile apps stand out from other competitors easily. Sometimes, it personalizes your logos and brands, leaving a great first impression on your audience quickly. A good font often means better readability, helping enhance user experience. Moreover, the visual style of your font designs also defines the overall feel of your mobile apps, providing a different visual experience for your users. In short, a good font has a direct impact on your mobile apps and helps enhance UX easily. You and your team should pay a lot of attention to choose or customize a good font for your apps. After knowing the importance of fonts in mobile design, let's learn how you can choose the right font for your mobile app. Here are some tips that you should consider: Before you search for an app font online, you should first figure out your design goals. How do you want your audience to react to your text and fonts? Do you use the font to only ensure basic performance and functionality? Or do you use the font to personalize your brand and leave a better impression on users? Answers to a lot of questions should be figured out in advance. The font you selected often would be integrated into your mobile app. It will also affect the overall style and mood of your mobile app. So, while choosing the font for your app, try to choose the font that matches perfectly with your overall design style and mood. A font family with a sufficient number of weights or styles would be great. No matter what happens, the basic function of a font is to convey messages clearly. The readability and legibility of a page matters a lot. A font that can help provide better readability and legibility would be a better option for you. The font size is another important factor you should consider. But, which font size is the most readable for apps? Or which is the best font size for mobile apps? According to a recent report, a 16px font is considered to be the best for eyes. You can read the font size guidelines to know the best body font size, text input font size, secondary text font size, etc.   Responsive design enables you to deliver content on different screens and devices smoothly, and has become very popular these days. To simplify your design process, you may also select a mobile font, which can be scaled on different mobile devices, for ensuring necessary design flexibility.  Choose a font that can be scaled on different mobile devices. Too many fonts used on a page can easily distract users' attention and create a very bad user experience. So, always remember to use one or two fonts at a time. To save time and effort, you can choose a font family to easily avoid such distracting issues. No matter what type of fonts you finally choose, you should always remember to test it in your mobile apps.

        "body": "Please support the OWASP mission to improve software security through open source initiatives and community education. Donate Now! This website uses cookies to analyze our traffic and only share that information with our analytics partners. In 2015, we performed a survey and initiated a Call for Data submission Globally . This helped us to analyze and re-categorize the OWASP Mobile Top Ten for 2016. So the top ten categories are now more focused on Mobile application rather than Server. Our goals for the 2016 list included the following: This list has been finalized after a 90-day feedback period from the community. Based on feedback, we have released a Mobile Top Ten 2016 list following a similar approach of collecting data, grouping the data in logical and consistent ways. Feel free to visit the mailing list as well! We adhered loosely to the OWASP Web Top Ten Project methodology. This page is a work in progress. If we have omitted you, or incorrectly affiliated you, please contact us right away. Strategy Document The 2015 data sets are stored at the below link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ts32chiqnglqvy4/AADVrJCV96xTsm_sxKILxF0La?dl=0 Key observations and trends from the data can be found in here: OWASP and the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) collaborated to build a joint set of controls. ENISA has published the results of the collaborative effort as the “Smartphone Secure Development Guideline”, which is published in 2011 at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/smartphone-secure-development-guidelines/at_download/fullReport. In 2017, an update was published by ENISA at https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/smartphone-secure-development-guidelines-2016. This document has been jointly produced with ENISA as well as the following individuals: 1. Identify and protect sensitive data on the mobile device Risks: Unsafe sensitive data storage, attacks on decommissioned phones unintentional disclosure: Mobile devices (being mobile) have a higher risk of loss or theft. Adequate protection should be built in to minimize the loss of sensitive data on the device. 2. Handle password credentials securely on the device Risks: Spyware, surveillance, financial malware. A user’s credentials, if stolen, not only provide unauthorized access to the mobile backend service, they also potentially compromise many other services and accounts used by the user. The risk is increased by the widespread of reuse of passwords across different services. 2.1 Instead of passwords consider using longer term authorization tokens that can be securely stored on the device (as per the OAuth model). Encrypt the tokens in transit (using SSL/TLS). Tokens can be issued by the backend service after verifying ￼￼￼Smartphones secure development guidelines for app developers ￼the user credentials initially. The tokens should be time bounded to the specific service as well as revocable (if possible server side), thereby minimizing the damage in loss scenarios. Use the latest versions of the authorization standards (such as OAuth 2.0). Make sure that these tokens expire as frequently as practicable. 3. Ensure sensitive data is protected in transit Risks: Network spoofing attacks, surveillance. The majority of smartphones are capable of using multiple network mechanisms including Wi-Fi, provider network (3G, GSM, CDMA and others), Bluetooth etc. Sensitive data passing through insecure channels could be intercepted. (9) (10) Reference: Google vulnerability of Client Login account credentials on unprotected wifi - 1 4. Implement user authentication,authorization and session management correctly Risks: Unauthorized individuals may obtain access to sensitive data or systems by circumventing authentication systems (logins) or by reusing valid tokens or cookies. (13) 5. Keep the backend APIs (services) and the platform (server) secure Risks: Attacks on backend systems and loss of data via cloud storage. The majority of mobile applications interact with the backend APIs using REST/Web Services or proprietary protocols. Insecure implementation of backend APIs or services, and not keeping the back-end platform hardened/patched will allow attackers to compromise data on the mobile device when transferred to the backend, or to attack the backend through the mobile application. (14) 6. Secure data integration with third party services and applications Risks: Data leakage. Users may install applications that may be malicious and can transmit personal data (or other sensitive stored data) for malicious purposes. 7. Pay specific attention to the collection and storage of consent for the collection and use of the user’s data Risks: Unintentional disclosure of personal or private information, illegal data processing. In the European Union, it is mandatory to obtain user consent for the collection of personally identifiable information (PII). (15) (16) 8. Implement controls to prevent unauthorized access to paid-for resources (wallet, SMS, phone calls etc.) Risks: Smartphone apps give programmatic (automatic) access to premium rate phone calls, SMS, roaming data, NFC payments, etc. Apps with privileged access to such API’s should take particular care to prevent abuse, considering the financial impact of vulnerabilities that giveattackers access to the user’s financial resources. 9. Ensure secure distribution/provisioning of mobile applications Risks: Use of secure distribution practices is important in mitigating all risks described in the OWASP Mobile Top 10 Risks and ENISA top 10 risks. 10. Carefully check any runtime interpretation of code for errors Risks: Runtime interpretation of code may give an opportunity for untrusted parties to provide unverified input which is interpreted as code. For example, extra levels in a game, scripts, interpreted SMS headers. This gives an opportunity for malware to circumvent walled garden controls provided by app-stores. It can lead to injection attacks leading to Data leakage, surveillance, spyware, and diallerware. Note that it is not always obvious that your code contains an interpreter. Look for any capabilities accessible via user-input data and use of third party API’s which may interpret user-input - e.g. JavaScript interpreters. Appendix A- Relevant General Coding Best Practices’ Some general coding best practices are particularly relevant to mobile coding. We have listed some of the most important tips here: Use the communication mechanisms provided by the OS. Appendix B- Enterprise Guidelines References Only the NowSecure Platform delivers automated 360-degree coverage of mobile app security testing with the speed and depth modern enterprises require.

        "desc": "Keep track of all the most important analytics for your e-commerce store from the Weebly app. Powered by Square, Weebly is a true workhorse in the mobile site development space. Google Play Tumblr",
        "body": "The latest smartphones come packed with a bevy of features right out of the box, but to reach their true potential you’ll likely want to delve into the vast marketplace of third-party apps. Since the launch of the Android Market (now known as the Google Play Store) in 2008, apps have been steadily improving the Android experience. From the apps that help with daily tasks like balancing a checkbook or calculating a tip, to integrated apps with business communication platforms, there’s an app out there for every purpose. With more than 3 million apps listed on the Google Play Store, the choices can be a bit overwhelming. We’ve done the work of putting together a list of the 100 best Android apps across a number of categories to help you pick the best apps for your daily life. Here are the best Android apps to download onto your Android device. Can 2 billion people be wrong? The biggest social network on the planet has a decent official app. Keep up with your friends and family, jump into instant chats, and stay informed with push notifications. Best of all, Facebook isn’t just a place to share content stolen from Reddit and Twitter, as the world’s biggest social media site has also been pushed out into sections for dating, shopping, and videos. Pair it with Messenger for the ultimate double-act. GOOGLE PLAY It’s probably the Android app, so it’s likely you have YouTube already — but that doesn’t make it any less essential. YouTube’s mobile app is sleek and intuitive, bringing the entirety of the video-sharing site to the palm of your hand. For those subscribed to YouTube Premium, you’ll have access to all the premium content, as well as special features like audio playback while the screen is off. But even when used as a free app, YouTube is essential. GOOGLE PLAY Sometimes unfairly viewed as the lesser version of Facebook, Twitter is the place where everything seems to happen instantly. Birthplace of the now now-ubiquitous internet facet, the hashtag, Twitter is the best place to be if you like to be on top of the latest breaking news as it happens. Follow your favorite content creators, actors, or crazes, and follow all the news, impressions, and opinions as they roll in. GOOGLE PLAY If you’re spending more time at home than usual, you might finally have the time to get to that connected-home project you always swore you’d do. If you are the proud owner of a Google Home device, then you already know the ins and outs of a digital assistant. The Google Home app takes this one step further, allowing you to control a plethora of connected smart home devices. It also serves as a command central for any native Google-connected device and your Google-connected accounts, like maps, contacts, calendars, and more. Google Play Netflix isn’t just one of the best video-streaming services; it’s the video-streaming service. There’s a huge selection of Netflix movies and TV shows for subscribers and the performance is silky smooth. It’s not just restricted to old favorites either, as Netflix has produced a huge amount of excellent exclusive content — though if you’re anything like us, you’ll just put The Office on again. This is as entertained as you can get from just $9 a month, or $16 a month if you want access to 4K content. GOOGLE PLAY Disney holds possibly the largest library of film and television properties in the world and they are all on Disney+. From Hamilton to The Mandalorian you’ll find something for every member of the family. As theatergoers are slow to return all around the globe, Disney has begun using Disney+ for major blockbusters like Mulan and Soul. You’ll also have access to original television shows like Marvel’s The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. There’s a seven-day free trial, and it’ll cost you $6.99 a month after that — though you can pay $70 for a year in advance to save $14. In March 2021 this increased to $7.99 a month or $80 yearly. GOOGLE PLAY Though it only recently launched internationally, Hulu has long been one of the best streaming platforms around. Major network shows currently on air are typically available the next day on Hulu as well as thousands of hours of original content and a catalog of licensed TV shows. Hulu offers various subscription models, including one that opens up the entire streaming library for $6 a month, and another that removes midstream ads for $12 a month. If you’re looking to cut the cord, Hulu also offers live TV with DVR starting at $65 a month, but be aware it costs $5 more if you want to fast-forward through commercials on recorded episodes. GOOGLE PLAY The content wars have been raging for well over a decade, and every platform brings something to the table. Amazon Prime offers some fantastic originals on its streaming platform, which also serves as a great home base for its extensive catalog. Prime Video also allows you to add all your favorite subscription channels to your feed. We’ve also found the best movies on Amazon Prime to start watching today if you’re interested. GOOGLE PLAY With the streaming wars hotter than ever before AT&T wasn’t about to let Warner Media go without a fight. HBO Max launched in the summer of 2020 and brings with it all the HBO content audiences are already familiar with, with the added benefit of original content produced exclusively for the streaming platform. In 2021 HBO Max announced that all Warner property films will launch in theaters and on HBO Max simultaneously as studios clamor for return on investments in this new theater-less world, so you can catch blockbusters like Mortal Kombat from the comfort of your living room. Google Play Using an Android smartphone doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy one of Apple’s best current products. Apple TV+ is Apple’s answer to the ever-growing sector of streaming platforms. With hits like Emmy Award-winning Ted Lasso, Apple is establishing itself as a serious player in television and film development for at-home consumption. They’ve teamed up with the likes of Oprah, Prince Harry, Jon Stewart, and countless others to develop a respectable and growing library of content. Google Play Spotify is probably the first name that springs to mind when you think about music apps — and for good reason as it’s one of the best streaming services out there. There’s a massive selection of music on offer, from the latest huge releases to up-and-coming acts. Spotify also now offers video support for some of the best podcasts on their platform. There’s a free version if you want to try it out, but if you want ad-free listening, to download music, play any song, and have unlimited skips, then you’ll need to subscribe for $10 a month, though Spotify does offer a generous three-month free trial. Spotify also offers a family household plan for $15 a month, a student account at the reduced cost of $5 a month, and a “Duo” account covering two people in the same household for $13 a month. GOOGLE PLAY If you’re looking for an all-you-can-eat buffet of sound with no ads and no subscription fees, you’ve found it. You can discover new music and stream it from the cloud, but this is no Spotify replacement — most of the music on Soundcloud is from relatively unknown artists, and if you’re not able to find it on Spotify, you can probably find it here. Listening is free, with the pro versions of SoundCloud mostly being for the artists themselves. It’s not just about music, though, as you’ll find a lot of podcasts on here too. A great complement to another music streaming service. GOOGLE PLAY Believe it or not, radio is still alive and kicking, and iHeartRadio puts thousands of FM and AM radio stations right into your pocket. Not a lot of major smartphones in the U.S. have FM tuners, so we rely on great apps like iHeartRadio to listen to our favorite talk shows and oldies stations at the office, the gym, or on the go. The app also features podcasts, sports channels, and playlist tools. GOOGLE PLAY Google’s official streaming service is a worthy competitor to Spotify. Not only does the app provide a vast library of content, but it also allows users to upload up to 50,000 of their own songs for online storage. So if you’ve got a collection of MP3s from before the days when streaming was the normal way to consume music, upload them to Google Play Music and stream them from any of your mobile devices. Be warned though, it’s not long for this world. GOOGLE PLAY It’s hard to believe that Shazam was first released 19 years ago, blowing our collective minds and putting the concept of apps and their reach squarely in the zeitgeist. Today, Shazam’s integration and services go far beyond the simple song identifier it started as. Shazam can be activated passively to catch songs when the app isn’t open. Once you’ve identified a tune, you’ll be offered live lyrics to follow along with, as well as the option to add to your Apple or Spotify playlists. GOOGLE PLAY During these harrowing financial times and in a volatile macroeconomic environment , you’d be well served to stay up to date on the goings-on of our economy, markets, and financial news. The Wall Street Journal app places all this information in your pocket as well as the multifaceted award-winning journalism that’s been printed there since 1889. GOOGLE PLAY Whether you’re trying to follow international news, have friends or family in the U.K., or are just trying to stay in touch with newsworthy events stateside, BBC News has you covered. The BBC, an English government-funded news agency, has a long history of fair and moderate news coverage and is worth a look if you’re tired of American 24-hour news networks. GOOGLE PLAY The official app of National Public Radio provides a steady stream of straightforward reporting in both print and audio. Users can listen to news reports and various NPR staples such as All Things Considered and Radiolab. GOOGLE PLAY The Associated Press has a long-standing reputation for being one of the least-editorialized news sources around, as well as being consistently on the cutting edge of breaking news. So, if you’re looking for your daily dose of news without the added fluff, then AP News on Android is the perfect accompaniment to your morning coffee. AP’s self-ascribed description says it best — it’s “where the news gets its news.” GOOGLE PLAY Though it may seem like a no-brainer, the Google News app is a worthwhile recommendation, thanks to its smart curation and diverse news feed. Google News puts together news from sources all over the world, which makes it likely that you’ll find your favorite news source from back home within its catalog. GOOGLE PLAY Feedly is another powerful news aggregator that places all your favorite news sources in one place. The Feedly app is home to over 40 million unique feeds and offers integration with all major social media platforms. It serves as a one-stop shop for your favorite magazines, newspapers, YouTube channels, and more. GOOGLE PLAY With an international audience and a sport-loving home demographic, BBC Sport covers a vast array of sports in both live games and related news. Users can stream some sports live and customize their feed to receive up-to-the-minute information from their favorite teams, leagues, and games. Of course, no U.K.-based sporting app would be complete without coverage on over 150 football teams, so you’ll never miss a piece of news or goal again. GOOGLE PLAY Get the same industry-leading coverage you can expect from Fox Sports television right on your smartphone. Track your favorite teams, players, and leagues, and watch it all unfold live from inside the app. The Fox Sports app offers a complete experience with bonus cams and angles of the game you caught on television, as well as up-to-date sports news. GOOGLE PLAY Having the official ESPN app installed is a no-brainer for any die-hard sports fan, especially if you have ESPN+. You can quickly get the latest news on your favorite teams and leagues, including MLB, NFL, NCAA, MLS, NHL, and more. GOOGLE PLAY Barstool Sports has grown into an empire comprising podcasts, journalism, and content focused on pop culture, politics, and many other topics. It still keeps its roots in sports coverage and commentary. So if you’re looking to not only see pundits discuss your favorite team but also get a chuckle or read the latest political news, then you’ll enjoy the Barstool Sports app. GOOGLE PLAY Essentially Vine for a new generation, TikTok is the home of short videos that are amusing, meme-laden, and just generally fit for easy consumption. What started as the app Musical.ly, geared at miming songs while dancing, has bloomed into one of the fastest-growing social media apps in the world. Its algorithm has become legendary as it curates content for you based on what you like and interact with, and there is now content on the app for all generations, hobbies, backgrounds, and interests. GOOGLE PLAY Instagram is ubiquitous in photography now, so you might as well have it on your phone. Owned by Facebook, the social network centered on photos offers great filters and connectivity with others. Instagram has also been angling for younger market share with its TikTok competitor called Reels. GOOGLE PLAY The social network made famous for its disappearing photos has blossomed in recent years to become a full-fledged social media platform. With over 250 million active users, Snapchat is here to stay. Users can share snaps, stories, and their location on a map with close friends, as well as peruse the quality content of Snapchats biggest creators. From family chats, funny filters, or flirty messages, Snapchat is a platform for everyone. Google Play In today’s privacy-minded world, Signal provides an encrypted way to share messages and video calls. Whether you’re sharing sensitive work info or traveling abroad in a place with more prying eyes, Signal allows you to communicate privately and worry-free. GOOGLE PLAY Facebook’s best feature is arguably its built-in messaging. Facebook now offers its messenger service as a stand-alone app, enabling you to chat with your Facebook friends and anyone in your contacts with the app installed — without having to be signed into Facebook or even have Facebook installed on your phone at all. If you’re a parent, then Messenger Kids is a must-download on your child’s phone. Messenger Kids might seem like it’s built for kids, but it’s really built for parents. With the app, parents have control over their kids’ contact list, and messages can’t be deleted — meaning that parents can check in to take a look whenever they want. Of course, there are some pretty sweet features for kids, like kid-appropriate stickers, GIFs, emojis, and so on. MESSENGER MESSENGER KIDS The Google Play Store has no shortage of messaging apps, but WhatsApp’s secure end-to-end encryption and feature-rich interface mark it as one of the best. This cross-platform app lets you send and receive messages, pictures, audio notes, and perform video calling for free. A must-have for messaging addicts, travelers, and anyone with loved ones abroad. GOOGLE PLAY Kik has been around since 2010, and while its users have spanned from millenials to Gen Z its target demographic remains the young folks, You know, the ones that know what’s “bussin” and are way too cool for us, no cap. Use Kik to stay in touch with friends, trade GIFs, and form chat groups. GOOGLE PLAY Hugely popular among PC gamers and office workers, Discord is a place for messaging, image sharing, voice, and video calls. It features an intuitive interface that makes it easy to communicate and share with friends and co-workers. Discord is also home to countless communities where members with shared interests can hang out digitally. GOOGLE PLAY Tinder is the ultimate dating app for mobile users, thanks to its location-centric features. Regardless of what its reputation may be, it’s still a great way to meet people. Your next match could be a swipe right away. GOOGLE PLAY The online dating service OkCupid predates the modern smartphone era. Since its launch in 2004, three years before the iPhone, OkCupid has been connecting singles through the power of the World Wide Web. Today they offer a free Android app that helps you connect with people in your area. OkCupid remains a progressive online dating option as they champion the inclusion of all customers regardless of orientation or gender identity. GOOGLE PLAY In a crowded market of dating apps, Bumble stands out with a dedication to starting genuine relationships. For heterosexual matches, women have to make the first move, so men are encouraged to make their profile as appealing as they can — but it’s women who have the ultimate say in whether to start a conversation or not. For those not looking to date, Bumble also offers a BFF mode, which is perfect for meeting and making new friends if you’ve just moved to a new city or are just looking for more connections. Google Play The dating app of choice for gay, lesbian, bi, trans, and queer people of all sorts, Grindr is one of the biggest dating apps around. Using it is simple — let the app know your location, and you’ll be matched with other nearby members so you can chat, swap pictures, and hopefully meet up in person. GOOGLE PLAY Don’t worry if you don’t have a Kindle — you can still read your ebook directly on your smartphone. From best-sellers to the classics, it’s all here, with more than 900,000 titles in Amazon’s store. GOOGLE PLAY If you’re not a fan of Amazon, then Google’s Play Books is an excellent alternative.

By Shanon Roberts, on 15 March 2021 Without context, the most downloaded apps of 2021 so far may look a bit surprising. 2020 certainly saw its fair share of curve balls. Just about every industry and sector was impacted by the year’s events, including app downloads and this of course has carried over into 2021.  The COVID-19 pandemic has had a big impact on the most popular apps of the year. But, marketing hasn’t stopped, and if you want to continue your mobile marketing campaigns, it's important to understand which apps are dominating the market. In order to optimize campaigns, it is essential to know what your target audience's online behavior is and what are the best channels to connect with them. Let’s take a look at the current most downloaded apps of 2021 in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Keep in mind that certain apps that are growing fast (like Clubhouse) are not on this list because they are only for iPhone users and therefore not as widely downloaded. Do you want to learn more about how you can promote your app? Click here to schedule a FREE consultation with us!      It’s no surprise that TikTok is one of the most downloaded apps of 2021. By April of last year, the app had amassed over 2 billion downloads overall globally. Initially this app was seen as a Gen Z space only, but it has experienced an influx of new users due to world-wide lockdown measures.  As more users are stuck at home and on their phones, they’re looking for new ways to entertain themselves. Social media users are already attracted to video, and when you combine that with TikTok’s intelligent algorithm, you create a nearly irresistible app for users.  This statistic is great news for marketers as TikTok marketing opportunities are growing, from creating organic content to paid TikTok Ads.    As the number one app in the entire world, it is no surprise that Facebook is one of the most popular apps of 2021. Facebook has been especially useful during this time when people wanted to connect and stay in touch.  Facebook is consistently in the top 10 Apps in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. According to Statista, it is the most popular app publisher world wide, based on downloads. The Facebook family includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger. Facebook Advertising and marketing are two very important activities for marketers.   Rounding out the Facebook family is Instagram. This photo and video sharing app is one of the most popular apps among Gen Z and Millennials. Though this app likes to keep their stats under wraps, it's fair to assume that due to its popularity and unmoving status in the app stores, it has surely retained its popularity in 2021. Instagram is especially useful when it comes to marketing. According to Statista, brands uploaded an average of 0.7 posts to the social platform every day in 2018. Between IGTV, Instagram Lives, and Instagram Stories, the app provides plenty of opportunities for marketers to engage with their audience.  In Summer of 2020, Instagram announced their newest feature, Reels, which is in direct competition with TikTok. It will be interesting to see how this feature evolves over time and impacts downloads.    Speaking of keeping in touch, a fair share of social media apps also experienced continued downloads in 2021. WhatsApp has approximately 2 billion users globally.  While WhatsApp may not be as popular in the United States, it is the leading messaging app across the rest of the globe. It provides opportunities for businesses to keep in contact with their clients and customers through personalized messages, special offers and more. There are many interesting marketing opportunities with WhatsApp as WhatsApp marketing continues to grow.    Another popular messaging app is Telegram, a free app with about 500 million active monthly users ,which can be used to send photos, videos, and different types of documents in addition to regular messages. Telegram supports mentions, hashtags, and has cross platform availability, making it convenient for businesses and large organizations. It also makes it possible to create groups of up to 200,000 and to create both private and public channels, which you can invite your customers to join. This provides a variety of marketing opportunities as you can share images and information about new products or services, provide links to landing pages, create a chatbot to answer customer queries, etc.   A number of Chinese apps, such as TikTok are banned in India so others have been created to fill the void. Moj is a great example of this It allows users to make short videos of up to 15 seconds and add various effects to personalize them. Its simple user interface makes it easy for people to interact through comments, likes, shares, and so on. This app is relatively new, making its debuted in July 2020 and quickly racking up millions of viewers. It has over 80 million active monthly users who spend an average of 34 minutes on the app every day.   This app, along with a few video conferencing apps, was definitely one of the most successful apps of the past year. In April 2020, Zoom reported over 300 million daily participants and the app featured 38 million downloads in January 2021 alone. This boom is directly linked to the COVID-19 crisis. As many users across the globe had to continue working from home, they used Zoom as their video-conferencing app of choice. Zoom allows users to conduct video calls for business or for keeping in touch with loved ones.    Snapchat has been downloaded well over 200 million times and is especially popular with a young demographic of people 34 and under, particularly in the United States. Snapchat can be used both for fun and for business as it has a feature called Instant Create that lets you quickly and easily make ads and then share them based on location in order to make sure they are seen by your target demographic. In this way, Snapchat can be a useful marketing tool   Like WhatsApp and Facebook itself, Facebook Messenger is another heavy hitter and consistent favorite in the app store. Unlike WhatsApp, Messenger is very popular in the United States and is expected to reach 2.4 billion users in 2021.  Like many of the other apps on this list, Facebook Messenger can be used effectively for both personal and professional communication. Whether sharing photos with friends or sharing a new product or service with followers, this app allows you to reach your audience quickly and easily.   Like Moj, MX TakaTak is another video sharing app from India that lets you can create your own videos, see what's trending at a given time, and search for videos on topics that interest you.  Although this app is primarily used in India, it does support content in English, making it possible for international brands and influencers to get involved. It also get has about 10 million daily users and about 45 million monthly users.   No one could have predicted that some of these apps would have become so popular. It will be interesting to see how app store downloads continue to evolve over the course of 2021, and we'll certainly update our blog with those figures as they start to come in.     International Digital Marketing Strategist Good nice Thanks fr your information.

        "link": "https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/most-popular-android-apps/",
        "desc": "LINE is the fourth-most popular instant messaging app on Android, behind WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Viber. Asia drives much of its popularity. It's in the top five communications apps in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Cambodia, and Indonesia. The app struggles to make the top 30 in most European and North American countries, however.",
        "body": "What are the most popular Android apps? Here are the most downloaded apps in the Google Play Store! Many of the Android apps we recommend aren't popular in the wider community. Of course, they're all excellent—we wouldn't suggest lousy apps—but often you can file them into the \"niche\" category. For something different, let's take a step back and look at some of the all-time most popular Android apps in the Google Play Store. These are the ones that Android's 2.8 billion active users have downloaded most frequently. We're not going to include apps that come pre-loaded on stock Android devices. This means we're excluding Google Play Services (10 billion \"downloads\"), Gmail (9 billion), Google Maps (6.9 billion), YouTube (10 billion), and a few others. We've used AndroidRank's data to determine these numbers. The numbers in parentheses denote the placement change from March 2020, when we last updated this list. 7.073 billion downloads It's not surprising to see Facebook as the world's highest downloaded app. Despite seemingly endless scandals, questionable privacy practices, and the #DeleteFacebook movement, it still reigns supreme. Not everyone is happy though, as this app has 76 million one-star ratings. Perhaps it's justified; the app is bloated with pointless features that few people bother to use. Download: Facebook (Free, in-app purchases available) 6.983 billion downloads In July 2018, WhatsApp was third with 2.9 billion downloads. A year ago it had jumped into number one, but now it has slipped back down to second. WhatsApp—which is the world's most popular instant messaging tool—has been under Facebook's ownership since a $19 billion buyout in early 2014. If you don't fancy using a Facebook-owned app messaging app, try out one of the many WhatsApp alternatives. Download: WhatsApp (Free) 5.327 billion downloads The presence of Messenger in the third position reinforces the control that Facebook's empire has over the smartphone app marketplace. Messenger has grown in popularity over the last few years, with the increased availability of bots making the service more useful than ever. It's down one place from July 2018 when we first published this list. Download: Facebook Messenger (Free, in-app purchases available) 3.504 billion downloads Instagram is yet another Facebook-owned app, which the company acquired in 2012. It has significantly fewer negative reviews than its big brother, with just 28 million (out of 121 million) giving the app a single star. Download: Instagram (Free, in-app purchases available) 2.631 billion downloads TikTok's ongoing growth shows no signs of abating. The app, which lets users create and share short video clips, became immensely popular during the first half of 2020 as the COVID crisis forced people to stay at home. It broke one billion downloads in July 2019 and has more than doubled in the following two years. Download: TikTok (Free, in-app purchases available) 1.438 billion downloads At number six, we find our first game—and it's not Candy Crush Saga! Subway Surfers is an endless runner game that sees you flee down a railroad in order to escape from a police officer and his dog. Download: Subway Surfers (Free, in-app purchases available) 1.933 billion downloads And we're already back to Facebook. The Lite version of the app is aimed at users with low-end devices (packing 1GB or 2GB of RAM) and those who only have access to 2G data networks. There are a few subtle usability changes, but all the main features are present and work as expected. Download: Facebook Lite (Free) 1.895 billion downloads Given the popularity of Word on the desktop, it should come as no surprise that the Android app has also found similar levels of success. Keep an eye on the Microsoft Office apps—they will almost certainly shoot even higher when we next update the list. Download: Microsoft Word (Free, subscription required for some features) 1.655 billion downloads Microsoft PowerPoint is the second consecutive Microsoft Office app on the list. You've likely used it at some point to create a presentation or slideshow. Download: Microsoft PowerPoint (Free, subscription required for some features) 1.350 billion downloads Snapchat concludes the list of the top 10 apps. Instagram might be stealing all of Snapchat's best features, but the latter still manages to rack up more than 280 million daily users, up from 240 million 12 months ago. However, as a percentage of the total downloads on Android and iOS combined, that figure remains low. Is it time to start worrying about the app's future or does the slight increase in rank point to a possible revival? Download: Snapchat (Free, in-app purchases available) 1.541 billion downloads It's not all about social networks and games with popular Android apps. SHAREit is the first non-Google productivity app to make the list. The app offers a way to transfer large files between devices in seconds. According to the developer, it's over 200 times faster than Bluetooth. Download: SHAREit (Free, in-app purchases available) 1.513 billion downloads Netflix now has almost 210 million subscribers. It saw a massive boost throughout 2020, again, thanks to COVID. The service's blend of original content and old favorites has proved to be a winning formula, and the growth is showing no signs of slowing down as we head through 2021. It is the only video-on-demand streaming app to make the top 20. Download: Netflix (Free, subscription required) 1.301 billion downloads It shouldn't be a surprise to see social media apps have several entries in the list of the most popular Play Store downloads. Twitter is now the fourth most popular social app. In 2018 it was third behind Facebook and Instagram, but Snapchat has also now leapfrogged it. Download: Twitter (Free) 1.301 billion downloads Flipboard is a curious app. It doesn't garner the same number of headlines as many of its competitors, but as the 1.3 billion downloads prove, it's hugely popular. In case you don't know, the app collates news, conversations, and compelling stories around any given topic, giving you a one-stop-shop for the subjects you care about. Download: Flipboard (Free) 1.142 billion downloads You probably thought Candy Crush Saga would be the most popular game in raw downloads, but it comes in second. Regardless, 1.1 billion Android users love trying to line up different-colored candies. Maybe it's time to find a new hobby? Download: Candy Crush Saga (Free, in-app purchases available) 1.124 billion downloads Skype is a fallen giant. With the release of Windows 11, Skype is no longer pre-installed on the operating system for the first time in more than a decade. The business branch is shuttered from August 2021, and it appears that Microsoft Teams is now the company's focus. Expect it to drop out of the top 20 in 2022. Download: Skype (Free) 1.081 billion downloads It's perhaps surprising that it has taken until 2021 for Spotify to make the top 20. It is yet another company that has benefitted enormously from the COVID pandemic, with paid users jumping from 130 million to 160 million over the last 12 months. Indeed, the number has more than doubled since early 2017. It has 360 million users in total. Download: Spotify (Free, subscription available) 1.025 billion downloads Dropbox is one of the best-known cloud storage services around. It lets you store documents in the cloud, access them from anywhere, and share them with other users. Download: Dropbox (Free, subscription available) 909 million downloads Viber offers instant messaging, video calls, 250-person group chats, and encrypted communications. The app is one of the most popular WhatsApp alternatives in Europe and North America. Asian users still prefer LINE. It is the first app on the list that hasn't yet broken the one billion downloads mark. Download: Viber (Free, in-app purchases available) 874 million downloads LINE is the fourth-most popular instant messaging app on Android, behind WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Viber. Asia drives much of its popularity. It's in the top five communications apps in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Cambodia, and Indonesia. The app struggles to make the top 30 in most European and North American countries, however. Download: LINE (Free, in-app purchases available) So what have we learned from this tour through the 20 most popular Android apps as of July 2021? Our conclusions are thus: So now you know what the most popular Android apps are. Do you have them all installed on your smartphone? These Android apps are extremely popular, but they also compromise your security and privacy. If you have them installed, you'll want to uninstall them after reading this.

This is how our day unfolds.  +91 9526015617  sales@mindster.com   0495-3077403  hr@mindster.in   Do you know how many mobile apps there are right now? Believe it or not, there are more than 5 million apps across Android, iOS, and Windows platforms. But have you ever wondered how these apps are developed? or What kinds of tools and mobile app frameworks are used to develop these apps? We might have never bothered to ask these questions. But we can indisputably acknowledge the fact that mobile apps are an indispensable part of our lives, right?.  We get all our demands fulfilled seamlessly via apps, whereas business organizations strengthen their market using the same apps. It’s a perfect Win-Win! But the question remains as to how we can develop an app. Of course, a reliable mobile app development company can take care of that part pretty well. But having a clear perspective on the latest mobile app frameworks and tools gives you an extra edge when hiring a mobile app developer.  Table of Contents Mobile apps are proven to be the perfect tactic for businesses to strengthen their user base. And there is never a shortage of unique app ideas. All of it worked really well in favor of mobile app development companies. Developing an app doesn’t require you to learn complex programming languages. All you need is the right mobile app framework and a clear understanding of web-based languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A mobile app framework is an app development platform that contains many components like toolsets, compilers, debuggers, coding interfaces, and so on. So a developer writes the source code for the app, and then the framework renders the app for the desired mobile platforms by using different components.  There are many mobile platforms out there, such as Android, iOS, and Windows. There are different forms of apps as well. We’re not talking about app categories such as shopping apps or gaming apps. But in terms of how the apps function in a device. So that way, Mobile apps can be classified into three forms.  Developed for specific platforms like Android, iOS, and Windows. Apps utilize device features like RAM, camera, GPS, etc.  Functions via browser interfaces  The combination of both native and web apps  These apps are generally developed using the following frameworks.  Native apps are arguably the best quality apps in terms of their aesthetic and functional aspects. But native app development is comparatively costly. And the diversity of devices and platforms can be a challenge in ensuring the maximum user penetration.  So when budget constraints and the maximum number of users are the objectives, a mobile app development company sometimes opt for hybrid app development tools or cross-platform app development tools. So keeping all of these in mind, let’s see what are the top 20 mobile app development frameworks for 2021    React Native has become one of the go-to solutions in javascript based mobile app frameworks. Although relatively a newbie, React Native has garnered the love of mobile app developers in a short span of time. React Native is an open-source, cross-platform app development framework from the house of Facebook. We can build apps for both Android and iOS very seamless by using ReactNative. Its faster development and deployment processes are the reasons behind its universal popularity.  Many top apps like Instagram, tesla, Airbnbnb, skype, and amazon prime videos are developed using React native.    Framework7 is a platform that lets developers build Android, iOS, and desktop apps with a native look and feel. It is a free and open-source framework and is very easy to use and learn. If you are proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, that is all you are going to need to develop with Framework7. It provides additional support for Vue.js, React, and Svelte. A very attractive feature of Framework7 is the stunning set of UI elements that it provides. These include features like popup, action sheet, list view, layout grid, side panels, and several other most-used ones. This makes development in Framework7 easy, convenient, and very fast.      Flutter is an excellent choice for developing aesthetically pleasing mobile apps. By employing a 2D graphics library called skia, the visual aspects of the apps can be elevated to higher levels. Intuitive widgets, material designs, and eye-popping animations also provide an interactive user experience for mobile users. But the exciting thing is that visual exuberance doesn’t interfere with performance. Scrolling, navigation, icons, and fonts all are made to be seamless and identical to native performance. Unlike many other mobile app frameworks, the codes are written in dart language. And the codes can be reused for upcoming tasks as well. The backing of Google itself gives Flutter an extra edge of credibility.     JQuery is an HTML based mobile app development framework that is known for its user-friendly and interactive interface. It can be used to create responsive websites or applications for smartphones, tablets, and desktop devices. It has extensive operating system support covering Windows, Mac OS, Firefox, Blackberry, and Kindle.  This framework is touch-optimized, runs on a single codebase, and enables developers to create highly customizable applications or websites. It has a very powerful theming framework and supports various plugins like image slider, pop-up boxes, content slider, etc.      Xamarin is another cross-platform app development framework for producing android and ios apps. Since they use C# language, It requires lesser codes. So the coding process is faster. It also lets us share the codes across different platforms like Windows and macOS quickly. Since creating an app is a lot faster now, you may think that faster development implies compromised designs and performance. But the apps developed on Xamarin provide seamless native performance in terms of both quality and performance. IT giant Microsoft now owns Xamarin. So its integration with Microsoft visual studio is a bonus to develop the apps with increased control and efficiency.    Swiftic is a DIY mobile app solution that aims to empower everyone to create custom apps for their business. It makes app creation a very easy process where developers can import existing content from online and don’t have to start from scratch. It’s easy user interface, expert guidance, and beginner-friendly approach makes it one of the most versatile mobile app development frameworks.  The framework includes several technological trends like push notifications, social media feed, app promotion, etc. It is one of the very convenient options for mobile app development where you can create, publish, and grow your app from a single control panel.      Ionic is another universally employed mobile app framework that has quickly become a favorite pick for app developers. It’s a free app development platform that uses the combination of CSS3, HTML, and JavaScript technologies to develop native, web, and hybrid apps. Ionic is an ideal pick for developing hybrid apps and progressive web apps by using HTML5 technology. Hybrid apps have almost all the qualities of both native apps and web apps in a single app. That includes uniform designs, performance boosts, and support for all devices, and so on. The apps built on Ionic can be distributed across multiple app stores and installed on devices by utilizing Cordova or Capacitor.    Sencha EXT JS is another javascript framework that can be used to build both mobile as well as web applications. It is very much suitable for data-intensive application development and is mostly the go-to mobile app development framework for building enterprise applications.  Sencha EXT JS has more than hundred pre-integrated UI components in the framework. D3 adapter, trees, HTML5 calendar, grids are some of the high-performance UI components it offers. It also has a flexible layout system that significantly aids information management across different browsers, screen sizes, or devices.      The app development has to be seamless and collaborative at times to meet the objectives quickly. In that regard, Phonegap is arguably one of the most developer-friendly mobile app frameworks out there. PhoneGap is a cross-platform app development framework that employs CSS3, HTML5, and javascript depend on the platforms of devices. When we develop the app locally, we can instantly see how the app looks and works through the PhoneGap developer app without having to resign or reinstall the app to test the code. That way, we can also access device APIs that may be unavailable in web browsers. Developers can also use many Cordova plugins to make use of the device capabilities like camera, GPS, sound, and accelerometer, etc. to provide a native-like app experience.    Onsen UI is a powerful tool for creating complex mobile applications. It uses Javascript, HTML, and CSS to build excellent HTML5 applications. For the framework users, it supports the libraries AngularJS 1, Angular 2+, React, and Vue.  It offers highly optimized performance, with all the animations fine-tuned to perform smoothly on devices of all ranges. To provide a native look and feel for iOS and Android devices, it uses automatic styling on its UI components. This means they will change their appearance based on the platform. It provides a rich set of UI components that includes tabs, stack navigation, lists, forms, and many more!     The best way to pick the suitable app development framework is by comparing different tools with one another. So, in contrast to other app development frameworks, Corona is considerably fast, simple, and comprehensive. Corona is a free cross-platform app development tool that is best suited for creating high-quality apps and games for various mobile and desktop platforms. They use a robust yet lightweight scripting language called Lua for providing apps and games with higher graphics quality. They also allow you to test the end-products on real devices instantly. Once the app is built and deployed, the code/assets update automatically.    Monaca is a cloud-based, cross-platform hybrid mobile app development framework that offers fast and flexible app development. It makes building HTML5 mobile applications with Apache Cordova super easy.  It provides a flexible development environment, which makes it the perfect app builder. It started as a cloud IDE in the browser and then developed to provide desktop GUI tools and command-line tools. Now it also provides an extension for Visual Studio. It supports Angular1, Angular2, React, Vue, or any framework that you choose!     Mobile apps are developed on various technologies. One doesn’t have to learn every other language and tools to build an app. If you’re well versed with angular js and bootstrap, Mobile Angular UI is the one for you. It’s equally simple and quicker. Mobile Angular UI lets you build mobile apps using HTML5 with the inclusion of many essential mobile components like switches, navigation bars, overlays, and scrollable areas. All of these factors make angular UI is a worthy pick.    CocoaTouch is a mobile app development framework for building programs on iOS. It supports development for all the Apple devices like iPhone, iPad, WatchOS for Apple Watch, and tvOS for Apple TV. It is written in Objective C language and is based on the MacOS Cocoa API toolset. It supports multitasking, gesture recognition, and local notifications.      NativeScript is a perfect example of “two needs with one deed.” That means we can develop genuinely native apps with a single code base for all platforms. As simple as that!.  As the name vaguely implies, Native script works based on javascript technology by using frameworks like Vue.js and Angular. We can also transpile other languages to Javascript using typeScript. Nativescript also gives you direct access to all iOS and Android APIs, along with free templates and app samples. They have a collection of free extensile plugins for various purposes as well.    Meteor is another open-source javascript-based mobile app development framework used for building mobile, web, and desktop applications. Popular companies like IKEA, Dispatch, and Qualcomm are clients of this cross-platform framework. It allows developers to build apps for any device- iOS, Android, web, or desktop- with a single code.  It uses an integrated Javascript stack that allows developers to achieve functionalities with minimal coding required. It provides excellent enterprise support and effortless meteor hosting. It has a broad global partner community that helps developers with Meteor training and development.      It’s high time for web developers to switch the gear into the mobile app development field. Frameworks like Appcelerator Titanium embrace the idea of web technology-based app development. Appcelerator employs javascript for developing native apps for Android, iOS, and windows from a single code. The app development on Appcelerator goes beyond just developing the app. It also allows testing and eventually deploying the app all in one place. Its Titanium SDK is an ideal app development kit.

It supports iOS, Android, Windows, WebAssembly, macOS, and Linux. Its noteworthy feature is that it provides pixel-perfect control during development enabling developers to bring the platform-specific look and feel to their applications. Developers with knowledge in C# and XAML can make the most out of this powerful platform. It enables you to use editors like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or Rider. To speed up your app development, it provides ready to use Fluent and Material code snippets.      PHP development is an underrated platform in mobile app development. If you are a skilled PHP developer, Laravel is a natural choice for developing web and hybrid apps. They go by the motto of ‘Value elegance, simplicity, and readability in the app development cycle. Laravel is a free PHP mobile app framework that requires comparatively lesser coding. So the development process is considerably quicker. The fewer code system also allows us to detect and fix errors pretty quickly.    Mono is an open-source cross-platform tool based on .NET framework. It supports several operating systems like Android, iOS, Windows, and Linux. Several commercial software vendors and corporate enterprises use Mono to develop cross-platform applications in a rich development environment.

The most basic budget apps typically connect with your financial accounts, track spending and categorize expenses so you can see where your money is going. But many apps do much more than that. The budget apps below are crowd-pleasers because of their features. At the time of this writing, each has at least 4.1 stars (out of 5) in the iOS App Store and on Google Play, as well as at least 1,000 reviews. (Jump to the methodology.) PocketGuard, for a simplified budgeting snapshot Mint, for budgeting and credit monitoring YNAB and EveryDollar, for zero-based budgeting Goodbudget, for shared envelope-budgeting Honeydue, for budgeting with your partner Personal Capital, for tracking wealth and spending PocketGuard, a free budget app, connects your checking, credit and savings accounts and detects recurring bills and income. Then it shows how much is available for everyday spending by subtracting upcoming bills, savings goal contributions and pre-budgeted money from your estimated income. PocketGuard automatically categorizes your expenses, but you can also create custom categories and set limits for them. Bonus: If you really want to dig deep, PocketGuard lets you export transactions so you can play with the data in your own spreadsheets. Mint has you connect your financial accounts, then the app tracks and categorizes your transactions. You’ll get alerts when you’re over your budget in a particular category, if it spots a large or suspicious transaction and if you’ve paid ATM fees. Mint also lets you track all your bills in one place and reminds you when upcoming payments are due. All these features are free — including its credit monitoring service. You Need a Budget (YNAB) is for the committed user, no doubt. It’s based on the zero-based budgeting system, so you must make a plan for every dollar you earn. It also requires a financial investment of either $84 a year or $11.99 a month, after a 34-day free trial. (Students who provide proof of enrollment get 12 months free.) Those who pay this price can benefit from YNAB’s many features. You can connect bank accounts, set goals, contribute to savings and customize spending categories. You can also access resources, like app user guides, budgeting advice and free workshops. EveryDollar is a budget app that helps you track your spending and plan for purchases. It’s tailored for zero-based budgeting, which is a method where your expenses equal your income. With the free version of the app, you manually enter a transaction each time you spend money to account for it in your budget. Or pay for Ramsey+, which includes the premium version of EveryDollar (formerly called EveryDollar Plus). With this upgraded version, you can connect your bank accounts for a more streamlined experience and access advice content and other tools. Ramsey+ costs $129.99 per year after a 14-day free trial. Goodbudget is based on the envelope system, in which you portion out your monthly income toward specific spending categories. The app allows multiple devices to access the same account, so partners and family members can share a budget. Unlike most other apps, Goodbudget doesn’t have you sync bank accounts. You manually add account balances (that you can pull from your bank’s website), as well as cash amounts and debts. With accounts and income entered, you assign money toward spending categories, known as envelopes. The free version allows one account, two devices and limited envelopes. The Plus version, which is $7 per month or $60 annually, offers unlimited envelopes and accounts, up to five devices and other perks. Honeydue, which is new to the 2021 list, allows you and your partner to see both financial pictures in one spot, including bank accounts, credit cards, loans and investments. (However, you can choose how much you share with your significant other.) The free budget app automatically categorizes expenses, but you’re also able to set up custom categories. Together, you can set up monthly limits on each of these categories, and Honeydue will alert you when you or your partner is nearing them. Honeydue also sends reminders for upcoming bills and lets you chat and send emojis. Learn more about budget apps for couples. Personal Capital is primarily an investment tool, but its free app includes features helpful for budgeters looking to track their spending. You can connect and monitor checking, savings and credit card accounts, as well as IRAs, 401(k)s, mortgages and loans. The app provides a spending snapshot by listing recent transactions by category. You can customize those categories and see the percentage of total monthly spending that category represents. Personal Capital also serves up a net worth tracker and portfolio breakdown. These budget apps either didn’t have enough reviews or otherwise didn’t quite make the cut this year. But they looked promising and may work for you. Copilot (iOS only) and Simplifi, both launched in 2020, connect to your bank accounts, categorize your expenses, track upcoming bills and more. Clarity Money, a free budget app, tracks your spending and suggests subscriptions to cancel. Honeyfi and Zeta help you and your partner budget together. Mvelopes offers an envelope-budgeting alternative to Goodbudget. And unlike the other app, Mvelope syncs with your bank accounts. Don’t want to connect your accounts? Daily Budget Original (iOS only) and Fudget are simple trackers in which you manually enter incoming and outgoing money. NerdWallet has a free app that lets you track your cash, see your net worth and debt, and track your credit score. We chose not to include ourselves in the list above in order to present an unbiased view. We also offer non-app options you can try: Use a free budget worksheet to record your expenses. Explore online budget templates for a quick check of your finances. Estimate how to divide your monthly income using the 50/30/20 rule. Read a budgeting book. To come up with the lists above, we first reviewed 20 money apps. We examined the purpose of the app as described by its developer, price, budgeting method (if any) and types of accounts users could sync. We also wanted to know what real users thought of these apps. So we read reviews of the apps in the iOS App Store and Google Play, noting complaints and appreciation. We only included apps that, at the time of writing, received at least 4.1 stars (out of 5) in the iOS App Store and on Google Play, as well as at least 1,000 reviews.

Many times, right?  But how often have you acted on them? Probably never. To err is human but to ditch is just inhuman. And to ditch an idea is evil. The mobile platform provides you with the most effective way to work upon your business idea. In an era where mobile app development interlinks every little aspect of our lives apps are easily the best way to establish your business. An app is a natural marketing tool, as well. A mobile app idea can transform the very core of your business. Companies like L’Oreal combined AR(Augmented Reality) to make a virtual make-up app. The app got an emphatic response around the world. Check out the features of this cool app in the video below :   Table of Contents A mobile app is the most potent business tool in 2021. And there are plenty of reasons for it. Reason #1: More than 65% of people are using mobile to go online.   The above report by Statista reveals the global trend and usage pattern of people around the world. The statistics underline the definitive that online is the future of business. Especially when android app development is at its peak. Reason #2: Internet has attained almost 50% of global penetration  This analytics from wearesocial.com shows the growing penetration of internet across the world. The penetration is above 85% in developed countries and near 50% in developing countries. Since the most thriving economies like India, China, etc. are all growing, the numbers are going to shoot up soon.  Reason #3: The mobile share of internet time is crossing 50%  This trend is going to continue with mobile devices becoming light and handier. Industries have already taken the hint and are going mobile. Take a look at the sectors that have taken a leap into the world of apps. The mobile apps help them market effectively and reach customers better.   The mobile is now, right here and the future is born from this moment right here. Take care of your present moment, and the future falls into place on its own. So revamp your business with some of the coolest and never before mobile app ideas, we have in store for you.  “Mobile app ideas are those innovative business plans that can be implemented and operated through a mobile app. It could be a product, a service, or even a utility.“   Well, it’s been a challenging task to put down the first idea. Because priorities change from person to person. But we came to the understanding that food excites everyone. Well, hunger at least is something we all agree upon without much ado. And nothing satisfies you like a delicious homely preparation. So here is the first trending mobile app idea for you: An app that serves those with a craving for specific homely dishes and wants it prepared at their home. The app will include the list of verified home chef’s who are experts in particular dishes. Users can rate the chefs and make a list of the most loved chefs for different dishes. The app will be suitable for urban customers who are missing their home. The app can integrate booking the chef, sharing location to the user, and providing a route map to the chef to locate the user’s apartment. The app will better fit the ios app store as the target customers are likely to be well off and from developed countries.  If you are thinking, isn’t it too late to start an ecommerce business, let me tell you, it’s never too late. Although the ecommerce market is loaded with business ideas and almost every segment has an ecommerce presence by now, if you have a unique idea, the stage is yours. A positive aspect of the ecommerce business is that there is no limit to potential buyers. So if you can offer something that no one else can, you are sure to succeed.  It is important to find a niche and build around it. For example, in today’s times, where the Internet of Things is very popular, an ecommerce platform that sells smart home products will have great value. Similarly, as people move towards a sustainable lifestyle, they are open to the idea of reusing second-hand products. If you venture into ecommerce app development with such unique and pertinent ideas, you can make it big in the field.  Most of us have fallen into the following scenarios at least once. We hear a song, we like it, but unfortunately, we forget the lyrics, and all we have is the humming part or a fragment of the song.  Otherwise, some lyrics come to us suddenly, and we don’t know which song it is. In both cases, we steam our memory to find out the music. So won’t it be an excellent idea for a mobile app? An app to find out the song from a few lyrics or from the humming. It will be even better if you can sing the portion you know, and the app can find out the song and the singer.   A mobile app idea that has taken off with the onset of coronavirus is grocery delivery apps. While we saw big companies like Amazon start grocery delivery, we also witnessed the move of several local brick and mortar stores to online platforms. It guarantees one thing- there is a vast market out there for you to sell. Specialize in selling organic/natural grocery products, or focus on selling frozen foods. So fix an idea and start your grocery app development.   Those who have kids at home know how much space the toys take. And the kids, as they grow, interests change quickly, and soon the house will be flooded with a lot of toys. The next mobile app idea is to develop a platform where the parents can sell old toys or even exchange them with others. Exchanging can be a better idea, as your kid will be happy with the new toy and won’t mind losing the old one. It can save the parents from the hassle of storing old toys and save their money without buying brand new toys.    We all plan long dreamy trips. But when the time comes, we are all stuck. An intelligent travel planner can make a difference, though. The Travel Plan app idea gives a new dimension to the traditional traveller apps. It lets the user sync their office schedule with the app. It is possible with the Google MyAnalytics and other Office 365 tools. The app will collect data inputs on your favourite destinations. It will use your preferences and the schedule to match your common vacations to give you the best trip date. It will use BigData analysis to capture the opening time, the best time, and the essential places to visit for you and fit them all into your trip chart.  Since the inception of Uber, taxi app services have been in demand. By 2024, 1588 million people are expected to use online taxi services. Although it requires a certain amount of investment, the good news is that within a financial year, you can double the amount of your investment. The success of the app depends on the quality of services you offer. If you can assure good quality service, taxi app development is a promising field to enter into.   Gone are the days when people give a second thought before performing online transactions. Today, buying and selling things online have become very common. The popularity of classified apps like OLX, Quikr, eBay, etc., are proof of the same. Classified apps are more versatile than ecommerce apps and have better reach. Whether you have products you want to sell or want to help people find the perfect buyer/seller or have some marketing purpose, classified app development will have you covered.  Most of us would have ended up using things past their expiry date at least once. People often forget to track down the expiry date and keep on using the same product. It is an app idea with real practical use for everyone. So if we have an app to track down the expiry date of perishables, you can save your stomach from a disaster.   You are moving to a new flat or thinking about redecorating your house and have no idea about the interior design part. So why not develop an app for it. An Augmented Reality (AR) based app can give a 3 Dimensional model of how your house will look with the furniture and other designs. The app can solve interior design issues. Other features, like color suggestions, can also be included in the app.   Food delivery apps are not a new idea. It has been some years since they have made an entry into people’s everyday lives. But Covid-19 accelerated the growth of food delivery apps. So this is the right time to venture into food delivery app development with some innovative ideas. For example, an app that uses augmented reality to create interactive menu cards so that people can make better choices about what to order. This would add an extra dimension to your food delivery app and attract more customers.   Cities are magnets that attract people. Developed or developing the city is a space of very high population density. It makes space the most valuable asset in a town. We have brought you an app idea for finding a parking space in the city. It will have some prerequisites like setting up parking spaces, identifying the peak hours, congestion areas, etc. The app can leverage GPS and traffic analysis data from Google and associated services to pinpoint and suggest the most appropriate parking lots. The app can, besides, suggest parking early in the days of festivals, unusual events, accidents, or special events. This mobile app idea can indeed leverage the latest mobile app trends to win many hearts.  After the end of the school year, all the students will be left with their old books and tools. Some of these might not be of any need in the future.  Especially when there is a change of stream, there will be many school supplies left with the students. If there is an arrangement to collect old books and other tools like geometry boxes, other students can use them.  If an engineer can create a successful mobile application to collect these school supplies and give them to the student in need, it would be a significant venture.  It is the era where people make a lot of new year resolutions and do not follow them. People make many good decisions like learning new things, reading books, traveling around, or staying healthy. But these decisions don’t even last a month.  But things can be a little different if you get the constant motivation to fulfill the wishes. It is human nature to get inspired when someone motivates you daily. A mobile app is an ideal choice. If your app continually reminds you about the target, people will put in the effort. There can also be features to set intermediate goals. It will be a good idea if there are some appreciation messages too if they reach the goal.  Digital healthcare services have made the lives of doctors, patients, and healthcare providers easier. Doctor appointment apps are a useful mobile app idea that can help save time and effort for all parties involved. It can be an application that lets patients book appointments themselves or through a provider. Such booking apps save patients the trouble of travelling long distances and waiting in long queues. Doctor appointment app development is on the rise, and now is the right time to invest in one.   Our ancestors have walked this earth for over 6 million years. Hence, the nature of the solutions they found to illness vary from place to place. Today people travel a lot outside their hometown. Thus, the raw materials for those age-old Granny remedies may not be available to you always. Hence, the app idea to make a standalone healthcare app solve the problem. We propose an app that has a repository of all the home remedies — mainly classified on the geographical and cultural lines. The current location details will sort out the kind of medication the user can try out. There is also a need to classify remedies based on symptoms and illness. One can also add “call the doctor,” as a last resort.   The economy is going completely digital, and cashless transactions are the new normal. Several online payment apps have already won the hearts of people. But there is scope for more. If you can develop a payment wallet app with unique features and safe services, there is a great chance that it will make a big mark. Just think of how people have adopted Google Pay recently and how it has become a normal mode of money transfer now! If you have any idea on those lines, now is the time to act!  It can interest the music enthusiasts, and undoubtedly the number is significant. The music a person listens to depends on their mood. The kind of music a person plays when working will be different from party music.  The music depends on the person’s mood and the kind of activity they are doing. So why not an app to identify the spirit of the user and give them the desirable music.  The same can be done for movies too. If an app can suggest movies according to the user’s mood, they can avoid choosing movies from a big list starting from the genre.  In the past decade, we have seen the travel and tourism industry flourish. The period also marked the boom of mobile apps. So naturally, it led to the development of mobile applications for facilitating travel-related activities. An app idea that is much in demand and has a constant market is the flight booking app. To be able to book a flight at their convenience and not have to wait at a travel agency makes things very easy for people. If you can add some extra features, like weather forecast and rewards and develop a flight booking app, it has great potential.  There are usual sets of items that magically go missing like keys, spectacles, or tv remotes, especially when you are in a hurry. We spend a lot of time finding those.  Why not develop an app to find out these essential items. We can list the items on the app, and when it goes missing, the app can help you find those items.  With the help of IoT and Artificial Intelligence, the app can be practical. It can be of great use to everyone despite age.  Digitization is transforming every industry, and healthcare is on top of the list. There are several mobile app ideas related to this sector. Medical record tracking apps, fitness apps, wellness apps, remote monitoring apps- opportunities are endless! Recently, with the outbreak of Covid, telemedicine apps are rising in demand. It provides online consultation, making healthcare more accessible and wide-reaching. Healthcare app development has a promising future and will be a worthy investment!    A social-media like app exclusively for book lovers. Not all book lovers are wealthy, and libraries are so far and rare. Especially in the countryside and villages. This mobile app idea can make the day for book lovers. It is a sharing platform for readers who are happy to collect and share books. The users will register apps by declaring the books both online and offline they possess. The app allows readers from the location to chat, arrange meetings, conduct literary meets, etc. The app allows readers to make an online repository of e-books and facilitate the exchange of printed books. Apple better supports such utility-specific apps, as iOS app development integrates a classic touch always.  When someone is relocating or redecorating their houses, there will be a lot of stuff that goes into the trash, mostly because these things cannot be accommodated in the house. So there is an app idea, a platform to give away your used products online. It can be furniture, gadgets, or even clothes. You can give it away to charity or any other people in need.  People are no longer sticking to old school technologies to increase their business. Instead, they are finding new ways to reach out to customers. Salon apps are a great example of the same. We all need to avail salon services at least once every month. But in our busy lifestyle, it may not always be possible or easy. Salon app development creates a perfect solution for this problem. When people can access salon services at their fingertips, imagine the ease they would experience and the sales it would bring to the business!   We know how embarrassing it is when the phone rings while an important meeting is going on or in a religious place. It is not intentional; people forget to make them silent. So here is an app idea to avoid those situations. If the app can track the user’s location and automatically change to silent mode, it can be helpful. So while you are in a religious place or educational institution, you don’t have to worry about turning the phone silent.  Do you own a restaurant and are having a tough time finding some business with the onset of food delivery apps and the like? Or do you want a simple way to manage your restaurant business? Mobile apps can come to your rescue. Integrate a food ordering/delivery app to your restaurant business and increase sales tenfold. Or develop a restaurant managing app that allows customers to book tables and pay bills and restaurant staff to receive orders. Restaurant app development can help you stay ahead of your competitors and improve your business.   A great idea needs greater support. It requires the right nourishment and the resources to actualize it. Our sixth mobile app idea is to save ideas from pitiful demise. In this app idea, every user can create a profile and share their thoughts. It will require some minimum benchmark to give optimum visibility to provide the deserving idea of greater visibility. Collaboration from the investor side will be essential before developing the app. A proper user interface to make investors find ideas they are looking for will be vital in making it successful. The classification of ideas based on the industry is one way of creating an interface. This app can spur a creativity revolution like never before, a place where idea meets investors.  Another mobile app idea is for a social cause. Most might have wondered what the restaurants or caterers do with their extra food. It is probably wasted or going unused. What if we can feed the needy? What if someone can design an app to make use of these extra foods? An app that guides the restaurant or caterers to find out people who have no food to eat.  There are thousands of people who don’t have enough food to eat; many are there who can manage only one meal a day. So if a mobile app can help few people survive, won’t that be great.  App ideas emerge when needs emerge. As on-demand services are gaining more visibility and appreciation, it is the best time to introduce creative ideas in the on-demand sector. Creative ideas don’t have to be out of the ordinary. The best ideas are the ones that can make people’s everyday lives simpler, like laundry app development. In the busy everyday life, who wouldn’t love to have their laundry taken care of, right? By developing a laundry app that will pick up laundry and return cleaned clothes, your app will be doing a valuable service to many!  In the current pandemic time, the classes are conducted online. So there is no provision for students to sit and study together. An app to create virtual study rooms where the students can exchange their notes or talk about the lessons they have learned. It can be beneficial for every student, especially those who are reluctant to ask questions to their teachers.  If you own a car, you know car washing can be a headache. Every week or two, a car needs a good wash. A car owner either washes the car at their home or takes their car to a car wash centre. Both of these take time and cannot always be done at their convenience. So what about you develop a car wash app that will let customers schedule car washes from their smartphone itself? If you can provide some customized features and great service, it’s sure to be a hit!   We live in a world where talented people are looking for an opening and they can’t find it. Education is undergoing a substantial transformation with the evolution of mobile technology. Today, companies know that individual talent and skills always surpass certifications and formal recommendations. Creativity is the sizzling spirit in the informal ordinary being, formalism always unknowingly kills it. Bill Gates, Albert Einstein, Rabindranath Tagore and many more are examples of those who stood out because they refused to be conditioned by a formal “one-size-fits-all” schooling approach. This app will suit such dynamic and vibrant individuals. They may be seeking a trainer, a skilled specialist. The others may be looking forward to sharing their skills. The app will showcase the master trainers from various fields and the user can connect with them and arrange classes. The app will enhance the employment and skills simultaneously.   Color blindness is a common disability. People with these issues find it difficult to distinguish colors, mostly red and green. And we know how important red and green is, the traffic signals, grocery shopping, choosing clothes can go difficult.  An app to recognize the color blinds. They might often find it embarrassing to ask people around for help. If an app can help them identify the colors, it can help them overcome their disability significantly. It is one of the best mobile app ideas on the list.  An app that delivers fuel- sounds handy, right? We all might have gone through situations where we got stuck during a journey due to running out of fuel. It is a frustrating situation to be in! If you were urgently going somewhere, it could ruin all your plans because finding the nearest fuel outlet and refilling the fuel tank is an arduous task. Fuel delivery apps give an easy solution to take care of this. It enables people to use their smartphones to arrange fuel delivery at whichever location they desire. It is a market with a large potential and not much competition, so fuel delivery app development is a great idea if you have the interest.  This app idea can help you figure out the freshness of fruits and vegetables. When you are in a supermarket for daily shopping, you can use the app to check items’ freshness. The app can also have features to predict how long the thing will stay fresh. The app can be beneficial to people who have started living independently or for people who haven’t done grocery shopping.  Digital readers are growing in number. Being able to get hands on tons of information with a simple Google search has transformed many of us into online readers. The introduction of ebooks, and online newspapers, has further fueled digital reading. Investing in this trend, an innovative mobile app idea is a digital magazine app. It will help readers access magazines on their devices while helping the magazine creators reach a wider audience. You can go creative with what type of magazine you want to launch. It could be comics, journals, current affairs- the possibilities are many!    We live in a world where organic is the trend. But most people use even organic products with an internal conflict. They simply don’t know how it was made? This app idea will create a friendly partnership with the farmer and the seekers of health. The greatest reason farmers switch to artificial means is the cost and difficulty in producing organically. And the solution is to let the fund and the farmers meet.  Our mobile app concept proposes – own a farmer scheme. The app allows interested users to form a group or act individually. The individuals or groups will then connect with the registered farmers. The farmer will be displayed based on the items he cultivates.  Once connected the app allows access to the farmer’s field with strategically placed CCTV cameras. Round the clock access to area ensures trust and satisfaction. The funds will be transferred beforehand to enable farmers to get resources. The farmer may either choose to keep the money or a part of the produce. There are many top mobile app development frameworks available to execute the app concept into reality.  We all have that important day on which we need everything to be perfect. It can be an interview, a business meeting, or a seminar. People get excited or nervous. They often tend to forget certain essential things. If an app can predict all the possible disasters that can happen on the day, people can get prepared. For example, if there is heavy traffic, you can get late or forget your laptop. All these predictions can help you prepare better. It can be another add on to the trending app ideas of 2021.  Field sales is one of the most effective and tried and tested approaches for marketing. But it is not an easy field. A field salesperson may often have too many things on hand, which tends to affect their productivity and peace of mind. So what about a mobile app idea that makes their days easier? These can be daily target apps, where field sales agents can record and update their targets, order management apps where they can manage their daily order and ensure deliveries or agent tracking apps that enable agents to cover their entire assigned area easily. Field sales app development definitely has a good market and a promising future.  You open all your food delivery apps and keep searching for food and finally end up ordering the same old food from the same old restaurant. We have all been in the above situation. How about an app where people can find out the kind of food they want to eat. The kind of food depends on your mood. It can be super spicy biryani at times or maybe cheesy pizza. If an app can identify the kind of food you want and then all you need is to search for that food. It can save a lot of time and effort.  The logistics industry is growing tremendously and can hugely benefit from digital services. Good communication, ease of transportation, and assurity of delivery are three main aspects required for a logistics service. And what better way to implement them than via mobile apps? Some great ideas for logistics app development are logistics tracking apps that take care of consignments, management apps to delegate parcel services to drivers, and booking apps for vehicles.   United Nations is pitching up the need to go green in its UNFCCC forum to save the earth. And every one of us owes it to this beautiful green planet. And thus our 9th mobile app idea is dedicated to earth. Now, the app concept involves syncing your green energy grid and your conventional power supply to generate usage data. The app helps the user to get the amount of power available at his solar cell pool or wind energy, etc. The app will suggest a green target depending upon the user’s available renewable energy storage capacity. The app can integrate power electronic switching tools to allow switching between green and conventional power. You can work more upon the idea with the assistance of other power experts.  Huge offers on big brands often make us doubt the authenticity of the product. It is not easy to find out if the product is original or the first copy. Here is an app idea, to find out the authenticity of the product. The app helps you find out if the product is original and is from the claimed brand.  Other features, like brand information, can be included. If you can scan the brand name or the logo, you get more information about the brand.  Event management is something that has risen to huge popularity in recent years. Today, most events-big or small, employ an event management service to conduct events successfully. Doesn’t an app that helps them organize better and do their job more effectively sound like a good idea? The app can let them plan everything to the t, collaborate better, and coordinate every task most efficiently. As new event management companies are emerging and it is becoming a mainstream profession, building an event management app can add incredible value to the companies.  All of us have our times in a day. There are night owls and early birds. Our work depends on our mood too. The most important things are to be done when you are in your best mood. The coming mobile app idea is to find out your mood changes in a day. When is it that people feel the best and worst? According to the output, people can plan their day. It can make every day more productive and enjoyable.  One of the biggest challenges of the logistics industry is managing the truck fleet. Checking the availability of trucks, ensuring their arrival, departure, running status, and managing consignments- it’s a difficult task. A mobile app can greatly simplify things. It can save a lot of time and hassle. A simple app can be used to list all the trucks and their status so that all the required information is available at a glance. Developing a truck booking app to facilitate better transportation services is also a great mobile app idea!   The role of citizens in pollution control is paramount. Our next app idea is a tool that makes every individual conscious of the carbon footprint they are leaving behind. And it is based on Augmented Reality (AR) and machine learning. Before we move ahead, a few words on the carbon footprint for the newbies. It is the amount of carbon that we release into the environment as individuals, community or as companies. The app idea involves a scanner that needs the user’s fingertip assistance. Suppose you are burning coal for fuel (a hypothetical situation). You want to know the amount of carbon footprint it leaves behind. You can circle the activity on your screen to aid the scanner to identify the action. Activities that are unknown to the app database will need your assistance. The app will be self-learning and over the course of the month will generate a daily, weekly and monthly chart. It will also suggest the necessary changes in behavior, habits, etc. make your life more eco-friendly.  You must have heard about the famous dabbawalas of Mumbai. Dressed in a white outfit and Gandhi cap and delivering lunches to thousands of offices throughout Mumbai, they have received even international acclaim. The next mobile app idea we have for you is inspired by these dabbawalas. Imagine an app that will help you get homemade lunch delivered to your office! You are already rooting for it, right? It will be a great app idea that will attract several customers.  The idea is pretty different. You often find apps that help you to plan your trip. But what if there are places you would like to avoid. For example, areas where there is a lot of robbery or social issues. Or even the food that you should not eat, maybe because you are allergic to something or can give you a sour stomach. An app to tell you about the places you should not go to and what food not to eat. It can be a problem when you visit sites whose local language is unknown to you. The app can help you avoid undesirable situations.   What if you want to try a new restaurant, you don’t have a company. Eating alone is not everyone’s cup of tea. So what do you do now? An app to find your food buddy. A platform for people with common food interests, they can connect on the app and hang out.  Food is an emotion that holds people together; we have seen how successful restaurant app development has become. Food-related app ideas can be a big hit.   Who doesn’t like shopping? But what if you can get to try on the products for real. The app will use Augmented Reality (AR) to optimize the user experience. The concept is to make an online e-commerce application with things that you can try on. The store can have multiple sections like, gadgets, ornaments, make-up, clothes, watches and anything that a customer needs to try own before a purchase. Once the customer selects the products, it will qualify for charged or free delivery as you intend to operate.   With the arrival of millennials and gen Zs in the workforce, flexible work culture started to gain prominence. And with COVID 19 rewriting the way offices operate, the traditional office setup is also adapting to flexible work. In this scenario, an app that provides a medium for people to find flexible work would be ideal. The app can act as a platform where employers share the requirement for the skills they need, along with the period of hiring and details. Interested candidates can connect with them through the app. This can be beneficial for both parties. The new generation doesn’t want to be tied to a single job or a strict work schedule. Flexible work opportunities can satisfy their creative needs while also giving them the safety of work and versatility in carrying it out. For employers, this will provide a platform where they can hire based on demand. The need for varied skills is increasing day by day, especially in industries such as IT. Recruiting full-time employees for all the requirements would be costly and challenging to manage. Flexible work can be advantageous in situations like this.  Further, it can also be beneficial for students, remote workers, etc. who need fluidity in their work schedule.   If you are a sports fanatic, this idea must have definitely crossed your mind. Especially with the recent boom in fantasy sports with apps like Dream 11, sports app development is in the limelight. The great news about fantasy sports is that demand is plenty, and players aren’t many. So it’s definitely an idea worth giving some thought. Or, if you aren’t interested in fantasy sports, think of apps that provide online sports training. With the growing number of people interested in sports, it will be an app idea worth executing!   Readers have a never ending list of books to read. They are always confused when it comes to picking their next read. Mostly, they make the choice based on book reviews. However, it’s not easy to find credible reviews. Our next app idea is to help readers find book reviews easily. An app that helps people upload a picture of a book cover and use it to find reviews. Interesting, right? The app would fetch reviews from established platforms like Amazon, LibraryThing, Goodreads, etc. Users can compare reviews from multiple sites in the app and use it to make an informed decision on whether to buy or read the book!   Famous German-American writer Charles Bukowski said, “When I am feeling low, all I have to do is watch my cats and my courage returns.” All through the years, pets have been a favourite companion of humans. Pets are found to reduce mental illnesses such as stress, anxiety, increase happiness, and improve physical health. Keeping their pets healthy and playful is something every pet owner wants. Our next app idea is about fitness for pets. It can track the pet’s activity and exercises, analyze it and create a report. This can be helpful if you are going to a vet. It can also help you choose pet products or services based on pet’s activity. The app can also provide notifications and reminders to pet owners such as buying food, or time for walking, etc. It can notify the owner if the pet activity is abnormal so that they can get a heads up and give proper care to the pets. Our understanding is that ideas operate like a chain reaction. One thought triggers another idea and so on. So, utilize our mobile app ideas or have it trigger your imagination for new ideas.

        "body": "<img src=\"https://www.rootstrap.com/wp-content/themes/rs-blog/img/search-logo-mobile.svg\"> The usage of mobile apps in healthcare, MedTech, and eHealth has skyrocketed in the past 5 years. According to Liquid-State, in 2018 there were over 318,000 mobile healthcare apps available for patients, and approximately 200 new healthcare apps being built each day. This number is staggering, and we can assume that this number has increased substantially since the Covid-19 pandemic.  You are probably starting to question how healthcare workers are supposed to navigate through them all to safely recommend and even prescribe these apps to patients.  It’s definitely not an easy task. But don’t you worry, we have done the investigation for you! We will give you a background on healthcare apps, share insights on what patients look for in an app, and then share the 8 best healthcare apps for patients.  Health and wellness apps fall under the category of healthcare. Even though both are very similar, they do have very distinct differences.  A health app is categorized by the FDA as mobile software that diagnoses, tracks, or treats disease.  A wellness app is a mobile software that enhances or tracks the overall health of the user. These apps can address mental, physical, social, environmental, or even spiritual factors that relate to overall health.  As you may already realize, mobile healthcare app development has become instrumental for healthcare providers to be able to meet the ever-changing needs of their patients and stay ahead of competitors. Those providers that team up with digital experts to strategically design and build quality mobile experiences will enhance patient loyalty — which will positively impact their current and future revenue.  Digital health trends reveal that patients are turning to their smartphones more than ever for health advice, video call examinations, prescriptions, and to track their overall health. Healthcare apps provide undeniable convenience that patients value. The innovations in mobile healthcare technology offer patients reduced costs, immediate access to individualized care, and the opportunity to have more control over their health.  In the digital age, we have, what feels like, the world at our fingertips. We have access to endless information and data. Mobile healthcare apps for patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease provide data that change their lives for the better. Access to apps that track their daily numbers and progress allows patients and physicians to better identify treatments. This is only a small example of the list of benefits these apps have for users and healthcare providers alike.  Although mobile healthcare apps are intended to improve the quality of care for patients, the majority of them fail to match their expectations.  “Simply having a mobile app is not enough,” said Brian Kalis, managing director in Accenture’s Health practice. “Apps are failing to engage patients by not aligning their functionality and user experience with what consumers expect and need. Consumers want ubiquitous access to products and services as part of their customer experience, and those who become disillusioned with a provider’s mobile services – or a lack thereof – could look elsewhere for services.”  According to the app usage data, most of the healthcare apps have less than 10,000 downloads. This is an extraordinarily low number in comparison to all of the mobile healthcare apps available for download.  It’s obvious that there is endless opportunity for growth in eHealth, the healthcare app development market is expected to hit $102.43 billion by the end of 2022. In order for providers to grow with the industry, they need to identify pain points and pivot to create life-changing experiences for app-users.  Here at Rootstrap, we are expert medtech app developers. We’re passionate about creating healthcare apps that cater to patients and address the inefficiencies in the healthcare system.  We have found these are the top features patients look for in healthcare apps:  In general, apps that require a lot of time to figure out quickly lose users. The sign-in process should be smooth and simple. It’s great to have unique functionalities in the app, but the basic features should be easily accessible to the end-users. If it’s a health app, patients look for functionality that helps them save time on booking, changing, or canceling a doctor’s appointment. If it’s a wellness app, patients look for functionality that helps them quickly track information, review data, and the option to share information with a health practitioner if necessary. Apps should feel the same for Android and iPhone users. Patients look for healthcare apps that work well for iOS and Android users alike. Healthcare providers should look for eHealth app developers that can create reliable solutions for patients — no matter what mobile phone they choose to have. The healthcare app needs to provide clear and actionable information for all users. What we mean by this is that many apps fail to take patients with disabilities into consideration. It is important to cater to the needs of all potential users and provide reasonable and helpful functions. Patients usually download healthcare apps to learn more about their condition, the causes, and take action based on the available opportunities. It’s important that apps provide interactive tools to keep users engaged and feel that they are receiving individualized care.  According to AJMC, studies show that nearly 75% of doctors, ER, and urgent care visits could be handled via phone or video. It was also calculated that the average time for an in-person visit was 121 minutes. Many impromptu visits are basic and don’t need an in-person evaluation. Apps can save patients and practitioners incredible amounts of time if built correctly. Telehealth services need to provide the same or better experiences than conventional in-person doctor-patient interactions.  According to the Journal of Medical Internet Research, social features in healthcare apps enhanced patients’ ability to commit to treatment plans and healthier habits. Online communities provide a space to interact with others going through similar situations. Fostering a positive and helpful community for end-users will yield a great return on investment for all. Social features in healthcare apps allow users to connect and share messages of hope. This space is essential for those who have received an upsetting medical diagnosis and engaging with others can provide them with inspiration and strength during their road to recovery.  We have identified the 8 best healthcare apps for patients. These apps are not only meeting patient expectations, but exceeding them.  Generis is on a mission to help people improve their lives by understanding their genes. This innovative healthcare app is powered by an individual’s DNA. At first glance you realize that the interface is easy to use and aesthetically beautiful which may be why patients love it.  Generis provides DNA-based advice, fitness recommendations, food, nutrition, and supplement recommendations, and more. This healthcare app aims to help users understand their genes while providing safe, accurate, and actionable steps. The goal is to empower users through education to be the best version of themselves.  For the most use of this healthcare app, Generis can retrieve DNA data from 23 and ME and Ancestry.com. App users without DNA data from 23 and ME and Ancestry.com can still receive recommendations based on goals and lifestyle inputs.  You might be wondering, why does DNA matter? According to Generis, some bodies burn different sources of energy more efficiently than others, and other bodies respond to different workouts by burning more energy. Rather than trial and error or just guesswork, Generis found the formula to make the best-personalized recommendations for users.  Their genetics experts have hand-selected over 50+ genetic markers that have a proven impact on the wellness trait. Every claim that Generis makes is backed by scientific evidence in peer-reviewed journals. Teladoc connects patients to a board-certified doctor 24/7 through the convenience of phone or video visits. This app provides patients with quick and easy communication with doctors who are ready to listen and resolve their issues.  If medically necessary, doctors can also quickly prescribe medication and connect with the pharmacy of choice. Teladoc integrates Apple HealthKit to enhance user experience. This seamless integration enables providers to form a better diagnosis and import the patient’s most recent medical details.  This app has over 227,000 ratings and 4.8 stars. Patients love the convenience and overall ease of use of Teladoc.  This mobile healthcare app is a trailblazer in counseling. BetterHelp allows patients to have quick, inexpensive, easy access to mental health professionals. BetterHelp is a convenient way to get professional help from licensed therapists and counselors online.  With over 14,000 positive reviews, patients enjoy individualized private care through video chat and messaging. The reviews highlight patients who feel more satisfied with their online therapy sessions than with previous in-person therapy experiences. Online counseling provides a safe space for all. There are over 3000 trained, experienced and accredited counselors covering a wide range of areas — from depression and anxiety to family and couples therapy. This mobile healthcare app individualizes the experience and connects patients with counselors who best meet their needs. They also have group webinar offerings fostering community and support for patients.  MDacne provides users immediate access to Dermatologists. Gone are the days patients had to wait months for their Dermatologist appointment. MDacne is said to be the future of acne treatments. In less than 5 minutes, they are able to provide a treatment based on the user’s skin. The app is incredibly easy to use and has a wonderful interface.  MDacne has advanced tech that monitors skin, sets treatment reminders, initiates chats with Dermatologists, and provides recommendations that actually work. If patients are off-put by chemical treatments, they also shares natural remedies to help with the most frustrating acne issues like scarring, or redness.  How does it work?  This app has over 200k positive ratings. With the rise of prescribed medical Marijuana to cure various health conditions — Leafly has become the one-stop-shop for cannabis information. This healthcare app connects patients with doctors, clinics, and dispensaries in just a click.  Leafly’s purpose is to shed some light on the previously controversial plant. Their community empowers and educates fellow users about the thousands of strains. They provide safe and actionable steps backed up by lab-sourced data.  This healthcare app’s motto is to “make diabetes suck less!” MySugr allows patients to track their blood sugar, carbs, bolus and estimated HbA1c all at a glance. Users say that MySugr has transformed their lives. Logging their data daily has allowed them to have better control over their condition. Doctors are also allowed to review the data to better treat patients.  This easy to use app also provides users with motivating challenges and feedback to help cope with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is difficult to cope with and this app has been an important ally to many.  EyeCare Live allows you to connect with your own eye doctor through the convenience of your smartphone. It is not recommended to use this app if you are experiencing serious conditions. This healthcare app works best for patients experiencing dry eyes, red eyes, allergy eyes, or questions about contact lenses.  First, you are connected to a doctor where you are asked to record your condition through pictures or videos of affected eyes. Within minutes, your doctor is able to see you through high definition video to better understand and help resolve your condition.  Physician house calls were a common practice dating back to the 1930’s, and it’s popularity fell increasingly in the 20th century. Heal is determined to bring physician house calls back. Due to the COVID pandemic, Heal provides peace of mind, allowing patients to avoid exposure to contagious viruses at the doctor’s office or urgent care. With over 3k positive ratings, Heal is climbing to the top as one of the best healthcare apps of 2021.  With Heal, patients are realizing that at home visits enable doctors to get a holistic view of what could be influencing their health, by observing their environment and overall lifestyle. This holistic view allows doctors to provide better care and recommendations for their patients.  Heal is currently only available to 102 million Americans in the following states: New Jersey, California, Maryland, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, North Carolina, New York, Virginia, Washington, and Washington, D.C. For patients with insurance, visits usually cost as much as a regular copay. For patients without insurance, patients pay $159 per visit. Healthcare professionals are working diligently to transform their services and provide patients with the care and convenience desired. The innovative realm of mobile healthcare app development will continue to grow and improve. These apps are not always perfect but are currently providing users the care they need, when they need it. It is important for users to understand that these apps still do not completely replace in-person annual check-ups and patients should still physically report to professionals when necessary. However, as we’ve seen with the Coronavirus and similar epidemics internationally, unexpected current events can quickly prove technologies to be critical. During the US stay-at-home orders in spring of 2020, use of virtual doctor visits went up 50% or more. The same trend held true for other hard-to-disrupt industries, such as online education, which saw an overall traffic increase of 234%. Nonetheless, these apps have transformed the lives of many for the better and will continue to.  Frequently Asked Questions Fitbit and Garmin are the industry incumbents in the fitness tracking space at this time. Outside general health and wellbeing fitness tracking, there are also a variety of companies focused on niche health wearable markets, such as fall alert devices for elderly and hospice patients. Outside traditional insurance and health networks, there are a variety of startups focused on easing the friction for consumers with common health issues like the cold or rashes, who need fast care at an affordable price. Lemonaid, MDLIVE, and Doctor on Demand are good examples of this type of service currently growing quickly in the telemedicine market. Apps like Doctor on Demand commonly offer insurance-free consultations with MDs for as low as $75 per call. Most apps pricing will vary depending on your insurance status and the type of service required. For example, psychiatric sessions will normally cost upwards of $175 into the mid-hundreds, while basic consultations will normally be well below $100. Some of the best healthcare apps for 2021 are: ● Generis – DNA & Nutrition ● Teladoc – 24/7 Access to a Doctor ● Better Help – Online Counseling ● MDacne – Custom Acne Treatment ● Leafly – Cannabis Community ● MySugr – Diabetes Tracker Log ● EyeCare Live ● Heal – Physician house calls are back See how top healthcare app developers are able to bring these ideas to life.

        "desc": "Lineage 2: Revolution is one of the newer MMORPGs on mobile. It features some decent graphics, tons of content, and the usual array of mobile MMORPG stuff. It does have some unique stuff, though ...",
        "body": "Links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.  We’d also like to give an honorable mention to School of Chaos Online (Google Play link). It’s an MMORPG that is very much not like most other MMORPGs and even lets you do stuff like make your own quests. Read more: Price: Free to play AdventureQuest 3D is a rapidly growing MMORPG. It features a lot of the same stuff that most MMORPGs have. You’ll be able to quest a whole bunch, raid dungeons, create a character and more. Where AdventureQuest 3D really shines is its cross-platform support. You can play on mobile or PC in the same world with the same players. There is also support for multi-classing your characters, chat and other social engagement, and more. There are bugs present like most. However, they don’t seem to be as egregious as other games. Price: Free to play Arcane Legends has been around for a long time. Its longevity has made it one of the most successful MMORPGs out there. The game is pretty standard at its core. You’ll have three classes to choose from, each with their own unique set of skills and abilities. There is co-op play as well as PvP modes so you can play and engage with other players. It also includes various PvP formats to keep things interesting. The developers have done a good job of updating the game to keep content fresh. There are tons of things to do. It can get a little repetitive, though. Price: Free to play Aurcus Online has flown under the radar for most of its time in the Play Store. It strikes the usual chords as you can create your character, go questing, raid bosses with your friends, and even engage in PvP combat. Where this game really shines is the combat controls. You’ll use simple, one-tap attacks and skill releases that culminate in some fun, acrobatic attacks. The animations add a bit more eye candy to the mix. Most of the complaints around this one come from balance issues and pay to win mechanics in PvP. The rest of it seems to be pretty good. Price: Free to play Black Desert Mobile is one of the newer Android MMORPGs. It boasts the usual MMORPG features, including a large open world, character customization, plenty of quests and missions to play, online social elements, and more. Players have a choice of five different classes as well as a minor builder element with your camp. Of course, you also get the usual stuff like pets and mounts. This game seems to tick all of the boxes while having relatively few issues. It is absolutely possible to spend hundreds, if not thousands, of hours in the game. It’s free to play like most mobile RPGs, but at least you can use Google Play Points to earn free stuff. You can also earn Google Play Points if you spend money in this game if that matters to you. Price: Free to play Grow Stone Online is a retro style MMORPG. We don’t mean it acts like an old MMORPG. The graphics are 2D pixel art. It has most of the features of an MMORPG. That includes a vast world to explore, people to play with, many bad guys to kill, and much loot to collect. You can join clans and all of that jazz as well. It worked well in our testing. We didn’t disconnect and the controls are easy enough to learn. It’s a freemium game but you kind of expect that in this genre. It’s good for sure. More game lists here: Price: Free to play Era of Legends is one of the newer Android MMORPGs on the list. It boasts a less chore-based quest system in favor of more combat and more stuff to do. There is a large open world with a bunch of secret things to find and explore. Additionally, there is a PvP arena, mounts, and more You also get the usual fair such as clans, huge cooperative boss fights, and stuff like that. There is an auto-play mode if you’re into that or you can turn it off if you prefer a more manual approach. It’s still a free to play game and has similar pitfalls to others, but it at least tries to be a little different from most. Price: Free to play Lineage 2: Revolution is one of the newer MMORPGs on mobile. It features some decent graphics, tons of content, and the usual array of mobile MMORPG stuff. It does have some unique stuff, though. That includes a 50-vs-50 Fortress Siege mode that is actually pretty epic when it works right. You can do the usual stuff like questing, joining guilds and clans, and more. It’s a freemium game. Thus, it has a lot of the same issues as all of these other ones. However, it’s not too bad for a few dozen hours of fun as long as you don’t mind a few bugs. You can also earn rewards with Google Play Points for this title. Price: Free / $10.99 per month / $99.99 per year Old School RuneScape is, well, OSRS for mobile devices. This is one of the most interesting MMORPGs on Android. For starters, you can play it for free without any freemium elements. You can get even more content if you subscribe. Both of these are strikingly different from the freemium model that most MMORPGs use. The game also boasts hundreds of quests, a rich in-game economy, and plenty of other things to do. The subscription players also get a map with a ton of extra stuff. It works cross-platform and the developers do an above average job listening to players. The graphics are a little old school, but everything else about the game is good. This may be the best MMORPG on mobile right now and the regular version is in early access beta right now. These are two of the few games in the genre with a subscription model rather than a free to play model and they’re a couple of the precious few choices people have in that space. Price: Free to play Perfect World Mobile doesn’t have the highest download numbers, but it’s a reasonably decent MMORPG. The game boasts above average graphics for the genre, tons of things to do, and a large game world. It doesn’t reinvent the wheel so you have most of the MMMORPG stuff like mounts, emotes, the ability to play with others, and mostly standard combat mechanics. It’s been around for 13 years on PC and while it’s definintely not as expansive as the PC version, it’s still pretty fun. Just watch out for the in-app purchases because they can get absurdly pricey. Price: Free to play Rucoy Online is another one of those unique Android MMORPGs. You play as a 2D sprite. The game also takes place on a 2D map. It features three character classes that you can switch between at will. You’ll also get an open world to explore, tons of quests, and more. The game offers a full range of multiplayer options, including PvP and co-op modes. It’s a lighter, slightly refreshing take on the MMORPG genre. However, on the other side of that coin, this game isn’t as deep as other MMORPGs. See more: Price: Free to play Sins Raid is another newer MMORPG for mobile. This one uses mechanics from old MMORPGs while also remaining relatively modern. It has a small, but classic set of character classes along with co-op raids, tons of stuff to do, decent character customization, and more. Additionally, this one leans on the game’s ability to be playable both solo and with others so there is no pressure to hop on and immediately join a guild or anything like that. The game also has strategy RPG elements as well if you like that. This may not be an MMORPG in the purest sense, but it’s still pretty good. Price: Free to play Talion is another one of the newer Android MMORPGs. It has a lot of the same stuff as other MMORPGs, including the large open world, tons of quests, massive cooperative and competitive battles, and online PvP. We did enjoy that this game has FPS style PvP game modes such as Occupy where you capture a point and fire catapults at each other. Character customization is above average and the stories and quests aren’t amazing but they aren’t terrible either. This is an auto-play MMORPG so players who dislike that should skip this. Additionally, the micro-transaction strategy is very aggressive as of the time of this writing. You can still progress without them, but it takes longer. Price: Free to play Toram Online is a favorite of our readership. There isn’t a class system. Everyone is given skill trees that they can fill out as they see fit. You also have the ability to customize weapons and change their abilities. It adds up to being one of the more customizable MMORPGs that we’ve seen. The graphics and game play give it a Final Fantasy (jRPG) feeling. There is also a campaign mode with an option to play co-op. You won’t find an MMORPG like this very often. It does have the occasional bug and connection issue, though. Just something to be aware of. Price: Free to play Warspear Online is one of those MMORPGs that have been around for a long time. As such, it’s had a chance to expand its universe a lot. It currently comes with over 1500 quests, 150 achievements, PvP with up to five vs five combat, eight environments, and more. The character creation is also fairly expansive. You’ll be able to choose between four classes, two alliances, and 12 character classes. You can even take up crafting to make your own gear. The in-app purchase strategy is also fairly aggressive in this title. Price: Free to play World of Prandis isn’t a new MMORPG. It’s actually vastly popular on other platforms. Its mobile version is rather new, though. The game features simple 3D graphics, two regions to play through, PvP, raids, guilds, parties, and even a lover system. The game uses tribes instead of races, but they do include three. There are also six total classes. We’re calling our shot with this one. Its popularity on other platforms should help keep mobile developer going. Here’s hoping this one turns out to be as good as we think it will be. Thank you for reading!

Even though every application designing project is different from another, under no circumstance your design should be static. To make this possible there are several tools for mobile app ...",
        "body": "As per a recent report, 67% of global app users today uninstall an application due to its poor user interface (UI). Updated on February 10, 2021 Today, we see developers constantly working to improve their apps to bring in features that attract users. These improvements are happening due to changing user requirements. Earlier, users were happy with applications that could run smoothly even if their interface was not up to the standard. But now things have changed. Today people crave apps that fit in with their day to day needs. Besides, it is tough to get a mobile apps design inspiration that attracts the users.  Developers constantly work on getting new ideas, but the demand for a responsive and attractive interface for an application remains a constant need. The UI design trends today in the mobile app industry too portray a similar story.  The way mobile UI has transformed, it has become crucial to keep searching for a new idea. Designers have to keep an eye on everything that has come into trend or that might be in trend when it comes to UI mobile apps designs. The design should look decent on the eye but it should also be functional and responsive, that is what users demand today.  But let’s understand what UI is before proceeding with the examples.  Every software application that people use today has a user interface (UI). In simplified terms, a UI is essentially the way users interact with an application or a website. In terms of a mobile application, it is the way users use an app on the phone.  No web application or mobile application can be a success without an engaging user interface. It is vital for the designers to come up with a design that works a treat. Let's understand the factors that make UI so significant today, in detail.  A fine user interface may depict a hike in business for a developer. Here are three of the many factors why UI has become all the more critical in mobile app development today:  Today, the majority of users demand apps that are engaging and interactive. It is all the more imperative today to have a UI that catches the eye of people. Take an example of a restaurant app, users want to scroll down the food menu with ease and have to be clear about what the restaurant has to offer. This can be achieved when the UI is designed with due care. Perhaps an uncomplicated thing to understand, apps with a highly interactive user interface end up getting installed by thousands and millions of users. That eventually means a rise in your business as more users get to engage with your product.  Complexity is one of the unacceptable things for an app. Today, users prefer not to use an app that has a complex UI design. With a favorable UI design, you can tackle the complexity of an app. Now that we know the factors, let’s take in some recent examples of applications with a successful user interface (UI). The UI examples given below are of those amazing applications that have adopted the best user interface designs and are running successfully. The approach and implementation of these applications are worth understanding. It is not an obvious task to develop an app that is both useful and has a great user interface. Many developers are required to follow certain guidelines for app design to create an app that people prefer.  Having a stable mobile UI design is vital to attract users. As it goes, “The first impression is the last impression.” Having said that, it is important to create a sound impression. Below are some applications that developers can look up to for their next mobile UI inspiration: The design of this useful application is worth understanding. It has been developed as an AI-based application that allows users to search for the best possible jobs. The application starts with a short interview with a chatbot which is indeed engaging. The concept has been designed to welcome users on the app.  The chatbot asks the users a few questions about their related field of experience. They are then provided with job recommendations based on their answers. It is one of the freshest and easy applications with fine UI and something that has not been seen before.   The design of this application is considerably creative. It works smoothly and has bright colors to attract users. Zava studio concept is one of those apps where graphic designers have really put in their souls and developers around the world can definitely look up to this app for inspiration.  The event discovers application is for finding events happening nearby. The great thing about this app is its design. It is unlike any other event finding application. The UI of the app has been designed in a way that shows the organizers’ profile and information about the events in detail.  Integrating AR with the design of a mobile application is indeed a masterstroke. This application lets users manage and build luxury wristwatch collections. Users can buy products and even know how it will look at their house with the help of AR technology. The concept of this app is a piece of digital art that is tough to replace.  Another app that has a straightforward yet effective exercise layout, the workout teacher app tracks the physical training that every individual goes through on a daily basis. The application has been designed with the help of a cross-platform application development technology.  There is no application that can do away from social media integration. However, this music app did something else. The developer has designed a feed system into a music application. There are many mobile app design ideas that designers around the globe have taken inspiration from, but mixing music with feeds is an all-together different concept. Think of the fact that now people can experience music in a way they never experienced before.  Another UI design app that is rather a vivid food delivery app. This application motivates the users to follow a healthier diet. There are a number of categories available from where users can select what they want to eat. A proper sequence of food items is displayed for ease of use. The photos as well as the illustrations shown are in a vertical order and can be scrolled down smoothly. There also exists a call-to-action button to enable the users to add products to the cart.  The developers of the workout app have integrated Android application development with utmost creativity. To display more precise information about workouts and sports activities, cards have been used for user interface screens. A prominent number of sports activities are also available from which the user can choose as well as switch to various other screen modes as per their preferences.   This is a home screen app that offers upcoming bookings. The splash page consists of pure animation. It increases the ability to catch more and more customers. The color combination and typography acts as a perfect addition. Besides, the layout of the app gives a positive vibe to it. This enhances the user-friendly nature for the users and makes the app much more usable.  A welcome animation for the restaurant app seems like a great concept. This app has quality 3D graphics which are extremely attractive and fun to use. Before the sign-up screen appears, there is a mobile app branding in the same which is catchy for the users.   The designs discussed above portray how versatile developers can be when it comes to creating a favorable UI design. So, to sum up, the top 10 design examples for the user interface, here are the key highlights we can take from the article: Be it cross-platform app development or native Android application development, there is no replacement for a decent UI design. Mobile UI designs should be according to the needs of the users, and while some developers prefer following guidelines, others require to follow certain tips for designing a mobile app. Besides, Some of the applications mentioned above can be considered for mobile app UI designs.  With a strong knowledge of the latest UI/UX design trends, Ayush, the creative head of MobileAppDaily, is curating enticing designs from the past five years. His work helped in achieving the desired user experience for many top brands. Right now, he’s at the helm of designing team and is leaving no stone unturned to devise futuristic designs.

Then, we used the following criteria to narrow them down to our top 5 picks. Apps that Look Great On Every Device",
        "body": "Disclosure: This content is reader-supported, which means if you click on some of our links that we may earn a commission. Think it’s hard to create your own mobile app? Now it’s a no-brainer, even with zero experience. You can create a mobile app that extends the reach of your business without it being overly expensive either. We discovered the top five mobile app software providers out of the dozens. We studied each one. And found Appy Pie is the best for most users. They empower users with no technical skills to create simple apps that get things done. All with no coding required. We find this the simplest way to start building your app. Looking for an easy way to develop a mobile app, even if you have no experience? With Appy Pie, creating basic apps takes less than five minutes (even for beginners) with a dead-simple three-step process that takes literally just a few clicks. Plus, it’s the cheapest option we’ve seen. Getting a basic app to market sounds hard. But what if we told you it only takes five minutes. With Appy Pie, the process is as easy as it gets. In less than five minutes you can have a fully functioning app that looks professional and does what you need it to do. In just a few clicks, you can submit your app to Google Play and The App Store. Not only is it the easiest, but it’s also the most affordable option on our list. Hiring an app developer can cost tens of thousands of dollars and take months to a year to get a working prototype. Then, another few months to get a finalized app you can actually publish on Google Play or The App Store.  Not to mention the fact that you have to hire them again to make small changes any time there’s a new operating system update or you notice a bug.  Because of that, mobile apps used to be inaccessible to smaller businesses and those that are just getting started.  But the emergence of mobile app development software changed the game.  It makes it easier than ever to develop apps on your own, even if you don’t have programming experience. It also costs a (very small) fraction of the price.  A mobile app instantly gives your business credibility and your app icon on their home screen is a friendly reminder to come back. Plus, you don’t have to fight for their attention with hundreds of other browser tabs open at the same time.  It creates a self-contained touchpoint with your brand—one that you get complete control over.  Whether you want to create an internal use app that makes your business run smoother, a customer-facing app to build brand loyalty and make more money, a mobile game, or something in between, mobile app development software drastically reduces the barrier to entry.  Some of the most popular types of apps built with it include: While mobile app development software allows non-developers to enter the app development world, it’s not a perfect fit for everyone.  Experienced programmers may find some of the options on our list too limiting for their needs. And they may not work well for highly complex apps—you’ll probably need a developer for that.  But if you’ve been toying with the idea of creating a mobile app for your business and don’t have the time or funds to hire someone to help you out, mobile app development software is an excellent solution. Looking for an easy way to develop a mobile app, even if you have no experience? With Appy Pie, creating basic apps takes less than five minutes (even for beginners) with a dead-simple three-step process that takes literally just a few clicks. Plus, it’s the cheapest option we’ve seen. Appy Pie is a no-code mobile app development platform. It lets you drag and drop mobile apps, websites, chatbots, workflow automation, and live chat widgets into existence.  You can also use it to create graphics like your app icon, background, sales banners, and more.  It requires no development experience and is so easy that anyone can use it to create a mobile app in just a few minutes. We’re not just saying that—it really takes less than five minutes to create a basic app from scratch.  All you have to do is pick a name, choose a color scheme, make slight customizations, drag-and-drop the features you want where you want them, and that’s it.  What would typically cost tens of thousands of dollars and months of work by an experienced developer now takes less than an hour at a tiny fraction of the cost.  You can customize your app icon, your splash screen, fonts, and backgrounds as well.  Whether you want to create internal apps to automate basic workflows, customer-facing apps to build brand loyalty and generate revenue, Appy Pie is an excellent place to start if you have no experience.  Tons of businesses across various industries have used the simple DIY platform to mobilize and meet their customers where they are—nose deep in their smartphones.  Real estate agents will enjoy customizable push notifications, navigation directions to different properties, photo galleries, and lead generation forms.  Restaurants can use the pre-built order management and delivery features to streamline incoming orders in real-time, allow customers to create personal accounts for faster checkout, send delivery updates, ask for reviews, offer up a professional mobile menu, and offer discounts.  You can even create a separate app for delivery drivers that includes booking management and navigation directions to different customers.  Want to create the new Tinder? No problem. Appy Pie offers swipe-to-like technology, matchmaking capabilities, built-in messaging, and customizable user profiles.  There are more than 100 pre-built features you can drag and drop right into your app without having to touch any code or program the functionality yourself. Those features cover all the basics so you can add what you need in just a few clicks. The Appy Pie platform supports native apps for iOS and Android, hybrid apps, and progressive web apps (PWAs). So, it’ll work for you regardless of the type of app you want to build. There’s even a separate app builder for each platform so you can add further customizations to enhance the end-user experience for each device if you’d like to. Another cool feature is that you can install a test app on your device to play around with it and see what it looks like from the user’s perspective at any time.  This makes it easier than ever to make changes and monitor the effects of those changes before making them available to the public.  Plus, there are hundreds of articles that outline how to use every piece of the Appy Pie platform so you don’t have to spend hours figuring it out on your own.  From researching your audience and getting proof of concept to publishing and making money with your mobile app, the knowledge base covers just about everything throughout the entire app development process.  When you’re ready to publish to Google Play and The App Store, Appy Pie’s submission team is always around to help if you get stuck.  They’ll work closely with you to ensure your app meets each marketplace’s requirements so you can get accepted with ease and get your app on the market as fast as possible. With that said, they won’t handle the entire process for you like some of the other options on our list.  While Appy Pie is easy to use, it lacks advanced customization options if you want to take your app beyond its pre-built features.  And the design customizations are limited, resulting in hundreds of cookie-cutter apps that look and function the same. It’s great if you’re just getting started or aren’t doing anything crazy, but it won’t be sufficient for everyone.  With no developer-friendly features, there’s not a lot of room to expand your app past out-of-the-box functionality.  Another thing we don’t particularly like is that you have to buy an add-on package to remove Appy Pie branding from your app. However, the add-on package also comes with a dedicated account manager, unlimited push notifications, and free resubmissions for both Google and iOS. So, it’s benefits extend beyond removing Appy Pie branding.  There are three pricing plans to choose from, including: The Basic plan supports up to 5,000 app downloads and 10,000 monthly push notifications. Gold is good for up to 10,000 app installs and 25,000 monthly notifications. And the Platinum plan supports up to 25,000 app downloads and 75,000 push notifications per month.  If you’re just getting started, the Basic plan may be enough for basic apps. However, there are a lot of features you won’t be able to use unless you’re on the Gold plan or above.  Sign up for a free 7-day trial to take Appy Pie for a test drive today! Want a mobile app but don’t want to worry about publishing posts or adding products in two places? No problem. MobiLoud creates native mobile apps that automatically sync with your site so you don’t have to add another step to your workflow. Simply publish as normal and new content automatically shows up on your app as well. If you regularly publish content on your website or sell products online, developing a native mobile app that allows users to read your content and buy your products on their phones is an excellent idea.  While a mobile responsive site gets the job done, users still have to come back to your site to read your posts and buy from you.  If they don’t remember your URL, they missed that special promo email because it ended up spam, or they didn’t see your social media post thanks to an unfriendly algorithm, you’re out of luck. They’ll quickly move on to something else.  But with a mobile app, you take up a coveted spot on their home screen.  Plus, you can send push notifications—they have 10x higher open rates than emails—directly to their phones where potential customers or readers won’t miss them.  If you’re onboard the mobile app train and want to create one for your blog, online magazine, community learning or online education platform, news site, or online store, MobiLoud is the way to go.  It’s a bit different from the other options on our list because it directly connects to your website.  MobiLoud works with every CMS platform, including the most popular ones like WordPress and Shopify. So, regardless of how you built your site, you can easily turn it into a mobile app.  But the best part is that the direct connection with your site means you don’t have to worry about publishing content or adding product listings in two places. When you add something new to your website, it’s automatically published on the mobile app as well.  As such, your mobile app is always up to date with your latest content and inventory with zero work on your part. Essentially, the app takes care of itself.  Plus, you can easily sync your entire product catalog and existing content in one click.  So, you don’t have to reupload images or copy and paste product descriptions, blog posts, or news stories from one platform to the other. As for the actual building of your app, MobiLoud pulls the existing functionality of your website, including your theme, plugins, custom post types, and layouts, into a fully-functional mobile app that matches your site.  This is huge since it means you don’t actually have to recreate anything—you can keep what’s already working for you.  That combined with the fact that your content and products sync in real-time equal a cohesive user experience across every device. Which… is something you wouldn’t be able to do with a basic DIY app builder.  MobiLoud’s platform also comes with an easy-to-use configuration dashboard that lets you make small tweaks to the look, feel, functionality, and style of your app.  You can also use the built-in code editor if you want to add advanced functionality or significantly change the design. However, you don’t need to use it whatsoever to get your app up and running—MobiLoud is 100% beginner-friendly.  One of the platform’s standout features is that you can send push notifications directly from your WordPress dashboard.  You also get complete control over the look of your push notifications and when they occur. For example, you can easily set up a custom trigger that sends out a notification when you publish a new post, add a new offer, or ship a customer’s orders.  Alternatively, you can send them out manually as well.  Your users can configure custom notification settings based on their preferences so they never feel overwhelmed, and the app has a built-in message center so they never miss an update.  If you’re looking for a way to add new revenue streams, your mobile app is an excellent place to do it. MobiLoud helps with that by supporting most ad networks. Plus, you can easily set up content behind paywall or create a recurring monthly subscription.  Want to give readers 5 free articles a month? Maybe you want to reserve certain articles and features for paid subscribers. No problem—it’s easier than ever to set them up.  MobiLoud also includes all of the mobile payment processing software you need to allow customers to buy products directly from your app. Alternatively, you can integrate with any third-party cart, checkout, payment gateway, or customer review tools.  When you have your app ready to go, the MobiLoud team takes care of the entire submission and acceptance process for both Google Play and The App Store.  The team takes care of building it out for you, reviewing it, testing it, and submitting it. They even guarantee acceptance on both platforms or your money back.  To sweeten the deal, MobiLoud also handles ongoing updates and app maintenance for you.  There are three pricing plans to choose from for blogs and online stores, including: MobiLoud also requires a one-time $500 app submission fee that covers all the work they do behind the scenes to build, review, test, and submit your app to Google Play and The App Store.  While it may seem expensive, it’s the best way to turn your website into a native app if you don’t have a lot of time and want them to sync in real-time.  For news publishers, MobiLoud operates on a revenue share agreement that requires no upfront costs on your part. If you get a lot of traffic, you can create a custom plan without the revenue share requirement.  Snag your free demo to learn more and see if it’s right for you today!  When most people think of mobile apps, they picture customer-facing apps with loyalty programs, online ordering, and community building. But the folks at Zoho know just how many of us could benefit from custom apps that help automate day-to-day business operations.  Zoho Creator is a low-code app development software specifically for internal business use.  With it, you can create fully customizable mobile apps that help streamline your business, connect the tools you’re already using, and fill in the gaps if you have any missing pieces.  Because of its low-code nature, it’s not really suitable for complete beginners.  Even though it’s marketed as a beginner-friendly tool, it’s harder to learn and use than no-code alternatives and requires (at least) a bit of coding know-how.  The software includes both a visual builder that lets you drag and drop lines of code and a code editor for advanced customizations with easy-to-understand fields that make programming easier than ever.  This combo of drag and drop plus code editing makes it extremely versatile and a lot faster than coding mobile apps from scratch. But you can build from scratch if you prefer.  To help speed up the process further and make Zoho Creator more accessible to those with very little experience, there are pre-built apps you can use as a starting point. All you have to do is pull in the template and start customizing it.  All of the functionality you need is already there so you don’t have to start from a blank slate.  Some of Zoho’s pre-built starter apps include time tracking, project management, employee management, onboarding, logistics, POS, personal or business finances, and vendor management.  There are also nine pre-configured options for different industries that include the most common functionality that those types of businesses would need.  Your Zoho Creator account comes with a workflow builder that lets you use basic logic to automate processes between all of your business tools. It even comes with dozens of pre-built connectors and open APIs to make these limitless integrations easier than ever.  From automating payments, invoices, and approval processes to transferring data from one app to another and tracking inventory, the automation possibilities are endless.  Current Zoho Creator users built mobile apps to manage internal production tracking, watch invoices as they move through the pipeline, access lab results, manage inventory, stay on top of business analytics, track finances, monitor time, and manage PTO requests.  Regardless of the process you want to automate and streamline, Zoho makes it possible.  However, you can also use it to build customer facing apps and self-service portals that equip customers, vendors, partners, and employees with the data they need.  A custom customer portal is a great example.  All of your customers can create their own logins and monitor things like upcoming invoices, past orders, current orders, upcoming appointments, and usage data in one place.  Maybe you want to set up an easy way for vendors or wholesale customers to place orders and track upcoming shipments.  Alternatively, you can build a custom employee onboarding app to streamline the new-hire process and allow new employees to set up their personal information, make benefits elections, and finish their onboarding paperwork.  Zoho’s custom portals let your employees, vendors, clients, and customers interact with your business in a new way—right from their mobile devices.  Armed with the basics of programming and the Zoho Creator mobile app development platform, you can create anything you can imagine from simple time tracking tools and data visualizations to an all-in-one ERP software that connects your entire business.  If you’re on the top tier, you can easily turn your Zoho apps into native Android and iOS apps without having to recode or redesign them.  You can even publish the entire app or select pieces of it to ensure nobody sees what they shouldn’t.  There are three pricing plans to choose from, including: The private customer portal is an add-on, but the Ultimate plan comes with 1,000 users for free. If you’re just getting started, the Basic plan is more than enough with plenty of room to grow as your needs change.  Try any plan free for 15 days to see if it’s right for you and your business today! Feel too limited by basic drag-and-drop app builders? BuildFire strikes the perfect balance between overly simple solutions and big-business platforms that cost thousands of dollars per month. Includes a drag-and-drop visual builder plus developer-friendly tools for advanced customization that doesn’t box you in. Most DIY no-code app development solutions feel cookie cutter with very limited customization options. On the other hand, most highly customizable solutions cost thousands of dollars and require extensive programming knowledge.  BuildFire is a no-code, beginner-friendly option that falls right in the middle.  It’s not as easy to learn as something simple like Appy Pie, but you get way more flexibility to create an app that aligns with your vision without needing to know anything about coding.  You’re not limited to pre-built templates and its drag-and-drop DIY customization capabilities extend far beyond any other beginner-friendly solution we’ve seen. It’s also one of the few that lets you unlock developer-friendly features and limitless API integrations later on if you decide to learn development basics or hire a developer.  You may not need those features now, but they’re there if your plans change so you have plenty of room to grow.  It’s the perfect middle ground between spending thousands of dollars plus waiting months on a developer and using an overly simple app builder that doesn’t quite do what you need.  Because of its flexibility, you can use it to create apps that do just about everything. From internal use apps for your business to mobile ordering, delivery, ecommerce, content publishing, online learning, and organizing events, BuildFire can do it all.  The software is able to keep things easy for non-developers while allowing limitless customization because it features fully customizable pre-built templates.  Rather than requiring you to stick with the pre-built template, you can use it as a starting point and adjust it to your heart’s desire with a drag-and-drop editor. From there, you can extend your app’s functionality using free and premium plugins from BuildFire’s built-in marketplace.  They’re all pre-coded so you don’t have to write anything yourself. So, they’re incredibly easy to use yet they bring a whole new layer of flexibility you won’t find elsewhere.  All you have to do is pick the functionality you want, add it to your app, customize it, and you’re good to go with no coding knowledge required.  BuildFire’s pre-built features have been thoroughly tested and tweaked over the years at scale with thousands of different apps in various environments to ensure they work how they’re supposed to out of the box.  As such, you don’t have to worry about spending months doing large-scale testing of your own to get the functionality you need, even if you need something unique.  Some of the most popular plugins include maps, coupons, drip notifications, fully customizable push notifications, task management, flash cards, community forums, voting systems, forms, and a complete menu ordering system.  All of them are very plug-and-play, and they all work well together so you can add all the features you need with thousands of possible configurations in just a few clicks.  Plus, you can always add-on to existing features or develop your own with BuildFire’s developer-friendly tools for a fully customized app.  The ease of adding plugins to your app makes it easier than ever to create fast prototypes and test out different ways to add value for your end user.  The software also includes a real-time app preview so you can see what your app looks like and how it functions on different devices before publishing it to the market.  Despite BuildFire’s slightly steeper learning curve, it’s still a thousand times easier than developing an app from scratch. And you’ll be able to easily manage and update your app on your own without waiting around for your developer to (finally) get to those small changes you asked for.  After creating your app, the platform makes monetizing it a breeze.  You can set up one-time payments to unlock specific features or set up tiered recurring monthly subscriptions. And you get complete control over what’s free and what’s behind a paywall.  When you’re ready to go, BuildFire handles every part of the app submission process for both The App Store and Google Play.  All you have to do is click one button to let them know your app is ready and they’ll take over from there so you can focus on other aspects of running your business.  As your app starts to mature, you can use the intuitive admin panel to view user analytics, measure plugin usage, track downloads, analyze push notification CTRs, and more to continue improving your app over time with a data-driven approach.  One of the biggest downfalls of the BuildFire platform is that most of the common plugins aren’t available on the lowest tier.  You have to either pay for them separately (which can add up quickly) or upgrade to a higher plan. However, it does support both Apple and Android apps on the lowest tier, so you don’t have to pay extra for iOS.  There are three pricing plans to choose from, including: While it’s more expensive than some of the other options on our list, you get a lot of bang for your buck and it’s way cheaper than hiring someone to do it for you.  If you’re just getting started, the Growth plan offers more than enough to start playing around, get used to the platform, and publish your first app. Unity powers more than 50% of the top 1,000 mobile games and 70% of all NEW games on Google Play and The App Store. It’s one of the few game dev platforms that balances user-friendliness and programming education with limitless possibilities. Oh, and did we mention it’s free for small businesses? All of the other options on our list don’t quite have the features and functionality that’s needed for one important type of mobile app—games.  But that doesn’t mean you’re out of luck. Unity is an app development software specifically for mobile gaming apps. In fact, more than 50% of the top 1,000 games on Google Play and The App Store (plus 70% of all new mobile games) are built on the Unity platform.  So, you know you’re in good company and good hands when you sign up.  Besides supporting both iOS and Android native apps, the platform also supports more than 25 other gaming platforms, including desktop, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.  Because of that, you can easily turn any game you develop with Unity into a multi-platform game to reach more players around the world… and make more money.  It landed a spot in our top picks because it’s one of the most user-friendly game development platforms on the market.  However, you’ll get the most out of it if you have a bit of programming experience.  It’s an incredibly robust platform that’s very feature-rich, which can feel overwhelming when you’re just getting started.  That also means there’s a much steeper learning curve than there is with the other options we’ve talked about.  But the possibilities are virtually limitless. You can go as simple or as crazy as you want—including virtual and augmented reality features—which is what makes it so powerful and deserving of being on our list.  To sweeten the deal, Unity has strong partnerships with both Android and Apple.  So, it can deliver custom industry-leading tools specific to each platform which is something that most of the other game development solutions can’t offer.  To make your life easier, there are dozens of pre-built, fully-tested, and proven game foundations you can use as a starting point. They’re 100% flexible and fully extendable so you don’t have to start from scratch.  Or introduce the possibility of basic errors that slow down the entire development process.  But honestly, it’s so much more than just app development software. Unity offers thousands of design assets you can use as customizable building blocks for your game.  There’s a massive catalog of 2D and 3D models, full-fledged 2D minitigames, SDK templates, and more. Each one is completely customizable, so you can take them as far as you’d like without needing to start from square one.  Some of these assets are available for free and others are offered at reasonable price points. You can even create and sell your own assets to other developers to make some extra cash.  Unity also offers an immense online academy where you can dive as deep as you’d like into the nuts and bolts of developing games for different devices. There is more than 750 hours of live and on-demand video content waiting for you to watch and learn.  The team even developed specific learning frameworks to follow depending on how much you already know and where you want to go from there.  Essentially, it’s an all-in-one platform that guides you through every phase of game development from acquiring players and engaging them so they stick around to monetizing without sacrificing the gaming experience.  Don’t know where to start? No problem. Not sure where to go next? Hop into a learning framework. Want to place ads inside your game? There’s a training video for that.  Looking to add in-app purchases? Unity has you covered.  Aside from pre-built assets and training on just about anything you can imagine, the platform has a built-in visual script designer as well. It lets anyone who understands basic logic program in-game functionality without writing code.  So, artists, designers, and other non-developers on the team can keep things moving forward without needing input from a developer.  And it’s also an excellent way for expert developers alike to speed up the process.  Whether you’re a solo developer or you have a team of designers, animators, and engineers, Unity is infinitely scalable and comes with all the tools you need to streamline projects as they move from one team to the next.  All of these things combined let you quickly jump right into prototyping without the grunt work of coding your game from scratch.  Plus, all of your changes update in real-time to speed up the testing and iteration phase. Which ultimately leads to faster development across the entire project so you get it on the market as fast as possible.  If you’re thinking that this sounds way too expensive and out of budget, we would agree.  But that couldn’t be further from the truth. In fact, you can use it for exactly $0 if you make less than $100k and received less than that in funding in the last 12 months.  Yup, using the platform is free until you make more than $100,000 in annual revenue.  If you need more advanced features or surpass those eligibility requirements, you can upgrade to a reasonably-priced paid plan, including: You’re eligible for the Plus plan if you make less than $200k and there are no eligibility requirements for Pro or Enterprise.  Sign up to play around and get started with Unity today! We started our search for the best mobile app development software with 29 of the top options on the market. Then, we used the following criteria to narrow them down to our top 5 picks.  Native apps and progressive web apps (PWAs) are the most common types of mobile apps. There are a few mobile app development tools that can also help you create hybrid apps, but those are few and far between. Native apps are the ones you see in The App Store and Google Play. They’re designed to work on one specific operating system, hence the name “native.” Because of that, they’re highly optimized for fast performance on that specific platform. And they offer a lot of additional functionality users can’t get from a mobile browser, like push notifications and a distraction-free experience.  On the other hand, PWAs look and feel like mobile apps but run inside a web browser. PWAs adapt to fit any device and offer more functionality than a mobile response website.  So, users can’t download them on app marketplaces, which takes away a lot of the added value of having a mobile app. But you don’t have to develop or maintain a separate app for different operating systems and users get more from your PWA than they would from a mobile version of your website.  Put simply, PWAs offer less functionality than native apps, but they’re more affordable and require less maintenance.  Some providers on our list charge extra for iOS apps. Appy Pie, for example, only supports Android apps on its lower two tiers. You have to upgrade to the highest tier to develop iOS apps and submit them to The App Store.  With Zoho Creator, you have to be on the top tier to publish both Android and Apple apps. Otherwise, you can only distribute them internally.  On the other hand, BuildFire and MobiLoud have more expensive entry points, but the entry-level plans support PWAs, Android, and iOS so you don’t have to worry about upgrading to unlock different types of apps.  Unity supports more than 20 gaming platforms (including iOS and Android) and has a free tier, which makes mobile game development more accessible to hobbyists and small businesses.  We highly recommend native apps for every device. But PWAs—or Android only—are affordable alternatives if you’re on a tight budget, just want to play around, or want to test proof of concept before launching across all platforms.  If you have no development experience, no-code mobile app development software is the way to go. It’s 100% drag-and-drop, much like using Wix or another easy website builder.  No-code tools should have things in place that make it as easy as possible for anyone with no coding knowledge to quickly get an app up and running. Things like pre-built templates, themes, and wireframes are a great place to start.  You don’t have to learn anything new to use them—simply pick the template you want to use, make minor customizations, add your content, and you’re done.  Most providers offer industry-specific templates you can use that come pre-built with common functionality for your type of business. For example, a pre-built restaurant app would have online ordering and menu functionality out of the box.  While these aren’t required to get started quickly, they can make your life easier. So, it’s something to look for if you have no development experience and want to get started fast.  If you want something more customizable, you still don’t need any experience—but it will take a bit longer to learn and won’t be as plug-and-play. All of the options on our list come with a drag-and-drop visual editor you can use to make further customizations to your app without needing to touch any code.  A visual editor may take half an hour to get used to, but beginner-friendly solutions shouldn’t take any longer than that.  The good news is that once you get the hang of it, you’ll be able to handle your own app updates and maintenance. You won’t need to hire a developer or wait for them to get back to you to make minor tweaks when you want to.  Appy Pie is hands-down the easiest plug-and-play app development software for beginners on our list.  It comes with numerous pre-built templates and makes the process dead-simple. In less than five minutes, you can have a functional app that’s ready to publish on the market.  But if that feels too limiting for you, BuildFire is the next step up. While it has built-in templates, it’s much more customizable with more flexibility to create an app that matches your vision. While it’s a bit more to learn, there’s more room for customization and growth. It’s the perfect middle ground between a basic DIY solution like Appy Pie and enterprise-grade app development tools that cost thousands of dollars per month and require years of development experience to use.  The last no-code option, MobiLoud, is a good choice if you have a website and a decent budget but don’t want to spend a lot of time building your app.  MobiLoud’s team does most of the heavy lifting for you by turning your website into an app that you can then customize further on your own (if you’d like to) with a basic drag-and-drop editor.  If you have development experience, are interested in learning, or will have help from your IT team, low-code options offer a leg up in terms of customization and flexibility. You get a lot more room to develop custom functionality and app design vs. using a no-code builder.  While they also feature drag-and-drop functionality, it’s not as straightforward and you’ll need to know the basics of programming to get started.  Many low-code solutions also come with pre-built templates and functionality that you can customize to match your needs as well. It certainly helps speed up the development process, but it’s more of a foundational starting point to build on rather than a mostly-done app that only needs a few tweaks.  Low-code tools have a much steeper learning curve, especially if you’re just starting out and have no experience. But with some work, you can have an app that’s truly custom and unique.  For internal business apps, low-code is definitely the way to go since it handles data and custom functionality with ease.  If that’s what you’re after, Zoho Creator is our top recommendation.  Alternatively, you should go with Unity if you want to develop games, leverage virtual and augmented reality, or create immersive 3D mobile experiences.  In the last section, we talked about pre-built templates, themes, color schemes, and drag-and-drop editors that make it as easy as possible to get started. However, one of the biggest downfalls of using templates is that you’re usually limited in what you can do beyond that.  Appy Pie, for example, doesn’t allow for any customization beyond its pre-built templates.  On one hand, it’s very easy to use and 100% beginner-friendly. But on the other hand, it’s extremely limited and won’t work for you if you want to make further customizations. MobiLoud is excellent if you want to create a mirror-image of your website as a native app. But you won’t be able to do much customization on your own beyond the basics. Instead, you’ll have to pay the MobiLoud dev team to do it for you.  If you’re just looking to build a simple app that gets the job done or don’t want to spend a lot of time doing things yourself, either of those solutions will work great for you.  But if you want the option of advanced functionality and customization down the road, make sure to choose an app development solution that offers more than enough room for flexibility and growth.  Whether you end up hiring a developer later or learning the nuts and bolts of app programming yourself, the platform you use shouldn’t limit your creativity.  BuildFire is our top recommendation if you don’t have any experience now but want the option of adding more advanced features and functionality later. It’s easy to use for beginners but also has advanced capabilities that Appy Pie and MobiLoud don’t offer.  Essentially, you can turn BuildFire into a low-code platform if you want to, which makes it the perfect middle ground if you can afford it.  You can start with something simple to get your app on the market. Then, you can add advanced customizations around your target market as you learn more about them and who they are.  However, we recommend a fully low-code solution if you have experience under your belt, want to develop an internal business app, or are looking at developing a mobile game.  With these types of apps, you’ll need unlimited flexibility and control to bring your app to life. So, no-code options simply won’t cut it.  If you go this route, make sure you understand what programming language(s) the software uses. If it’s a little-known language—like the Deluge language with Zoho Creator—you’ll have a harder time finding a developer or the resources you need to learn it yourself.  All of the options on our list have basic customization options for layouts, color schemes, fonts, and images.  Some of them stop there, others give you a bit more freedom with the option of developer-friendly tools, and some give you full reign over the look and functionality of your app.  The best one for you depends on what you want to build, the level of control you want to have, and where you see it going in the future.  If you’re developing an internal use business app, you may not need to publish it to The App Store or Google Play. If you have MDM software and an IT team, you can automatically install the app on devices without ever publishing them to the public.  In fact, this is the best route to go since it means no one else can find your app on the marketplaces, thus keeping your app private.  Zoho Creator also makes it easy to give clients, employees, and partners access to your apps without MDM software or publishing to any public app marketplaces in just a few clicks.  But if you do want to publish your app to the public, the process of getting accepted into The App Store and Google Play can actually take longer than developing the app itself.  So, it’s important to look for an app development software that’ll help you along the way.  First and foremost, you’ll need a developer account with each marketplace you want to publish to. For Google Play, it’s a one-time $25 fee. For The App Store, it’s $99 per year.  Google is much cheaper and also more lenient on the apps it allows in its store.  On the other hand, Apple is notably picky about the apps they accept, which is why many providers only support iOS apps on higher tiers—it’s more work for them to ensure your app meets all of Apple’s stringent requirements.  Depending on what your app is, the data it collects, and who it’s for, the process of launching to the public can be quite intense. So, choosing a provider that’ll help you out or do it for you can save you a ton of time and headache, especially if you’ve never done it before.  Some solutions on our list will handle all of the reviews and the process of uploading your app to each marketplace for you.  All you have to do is click one button to let them know you’re ready and they handle everything else. The service may be included in your monthly subscription or you may have to pay a one-time fee.  Buildfire is one of few who will do all of the heavy lifting for you with no additional fees required.  MobiLoud will handle the entire review, testing, submission, and acceptance process for you. However, it’s not free—there’s a mandatory one-time $500 fee that’s due when you sign up for a monthly plan.  Other solutions may offer support and guidance along the way if you get stuck but won’t do any of the work for you. Unity falls into this category.  And others won’t help you at all unless you pay for an add-on or premium support packages. Appy Pie falls under this umbrella—you have to be on the middle tier or higher and pay for its add-on package.  Aside from the initial publishing of your app, you also need to think about app updates.  Small changes typically don’t require resubmission to the app store and can be done at no extra charge. However, bigger updates may require resubmission and some providers charge a one-time fee for all resubmissions.  To add another layer of complexity, you may need to publish a new version of your app when operating system updates occur.  Appy Pie charges a one-time resubmission fee every time these changes happen unless you pay extra for the add-on package. BuildFire doesn’t charge extra for these updates but you’re in charge if doing the work.  MobiLoud handles ongoing app updates for you (included in your monthly subscription) so you don’t have to worry about it.  Even if you choose software that’s easy to use, there’s a lot of work that goes on to get an app from idea to published on the marketplace.  And if you’ve never done it before, the process can be incredibly confusing.  So, it’s important to make sure that there’s adequate documentation, onboarding information, and training materials to help you through it.  The quality of online self-help definitely varies from one provider to the next.  Appy Pie, BuildFire, and Unity for example, have excellent resource centers that cover just about everything.  On the other hand, Zoho Creator’s documentation and training materials are pretty poor. Which… is one of it’s biggest downfalls since it’s a low-code option that’s not particularly easy to use for non-developers.  While finding quick answers in online help forums and knowledge bases is excellent, you should also be able to easily reach an actual human if you can’t find what you need.  Tech support quality and timeliness can make or break your app building experience.  This is especially true if you’ve never done it before or get stuck and have to wait days or even weeks for an initial response.  Some of the options on our list offer hands-on 24/7 support. However, others limit support hours to weekdays during normal business hours unless you’re on an expensive plan or pay extra for premium support. Obviously around the clock support is ideal since you never know when you’re going to hit a snag or experience unexpected downtime.  If your app does go down, you need reps that work nonstop to resolve the issue and figure out what caused it in the first place to ensure it doesn’t happen again.  Otherwise, you’re missing out on revenue and hurting your online reputation.  But it also goes beyond support availability. You deserve tech support that’s down to help you through whatever issues you’re experiencing. The best reps will even do a lot of the heavy behind-the-scenes lifting for you.  Which… is particularly helpful if you’re not tech savvy or if you’ve never built an app before.  This level of hands-on support can help you overcome obstacles that could have taken you weeks or even months to figure out on your own.  If you’re on tight time constraints, have a more open-ended question that may take some time to work through, or don’t want to wait around, look for an option that lets you schedule support appointments to make the best use of everyone’s time.  From bugs and software issues to help with logic, specific features, strategy, and customizations, you should have no issues getting in touch with someone who can help.  They should also stick with you until all of your questions are answered—you should never be left without a resolution.  One of the best ways to gauge customer support is to sign up for a free trial or free plan and get elbow’s deep in the software.

Learn more By Adam Marshall last updated June 30, 2021 The most reliable ways to stay safe on the move Having a VPN is such a handy bit of software, it's no great surprise that you're trying to work out what the best mobile VPN app to download is. The top mobile VPNs can do so much more than protect your data – the power to unblock regional Netflix libraries, avoid trackers and access ISP-blocked websites will be at your fingertips. Many providers have fantastically-designed mobile VPN apps for all your devices – iOS and Android universally included – and allow you to use your subscription to protect yourself on public Wi-Fi networks, access online banking securely and stream with impunity while out and about.  To make our top five list of best mobile VPNs, services must have both impeccable desktop performance and provide mobile customers exactly the same security and freedom when they’re on the move. Today's top 3 best mobile VPN apps: 1. ExpressVPN has the best mobile VPN apps ExpressVPN has the speed, security and simplicity of use that really makes it stand out from the crowd. That's no different on Android or iOS, which makes using a VPN on your smartphone an absolute doddle - plus, it comes with a no-questions-asked 30 day money back guarantee and 3 months extra free.  2. NordVPN - well-featured and popular mobile VPN NordVPN's popularity is not unfounded. We personally prefer the user interface on Express, but the Nord mobile VPN really brings the goods when it comes to security and speed. And you can set it to come on automatically whenever you join an unsecure Wi-Fi network away from home.  3. Surfshark - bargain VPN for your mobile This could well be your VPN of choice if you're after something a bit more affordable. Go for its multiyear plan and get the price down to less than $2.50 USD per month. That doesn't prevent it from being a really strong and simple-to-operate mobile VPN though, with a very friendly interface.   The very best mobile VPN Maximum devices supported: 5 | Play Store rating: 4.6 | App Store rating:: 4.6 Best mobile VPN 2021 - Get 3 months free with an annual plan If you’re after the best all-round mobile VPN service, look no further than ExpressVPN. This service also tops our overall best VPN list, and that’s in part due to the great functionality of its iOS and Android apps.  The apps provide a straightforward overview of all the functions available, including split tunnelling, protocol selection and location picker to name a few.  Unusually, it’s actually simpler to access some of ExpressVPN’s additional features through the app rather than the desktop client – this includes displaying your current IP, DNS or WebRTC leak detection and a secure password generator.  Both iOS and Android VPN apps are simple to install, and after a moment of authorising system permissions you’ll have your mobile device protected. A nice addition is the ability to switch servers in one tap without closing your current connection. A simple touch, but one we’d miss if it wasn’t available. Beneath the clean app design, though, is still ExpressVPN’s renowned reliability and swift connection speeds – this is no mere facade. You’ll receive exactly the same customer support through the app as you will through the desktop client, be able to browse numerous Netflix libraries and, most importantly, keep your mobile device as secure as your desktop at home. And talking of other devices, ExpressVPN has some of the most wide and varied compatibility of any provider out there. Get the best mobile VPN 2021: try risk-free for 30 days If you're still not 100% convinced, the good news is that you can try ExpressVPN courtesy of its 30-day money back guarantee. If you change your mind, you can cancel and get a full refund without quibbles. If you do sign up for a year, Express throws in an extra 3 months free - great value and a fantastic app!   Well-featured and popular VPN for mobile Maximum devices supported: 6 | Play Store rating: 4.3 | App Store rating:: 4.6 While NordVPN does everything you’d expect from a premium VPN service, those who look a little deeper will notice that there are some useful, unusual features lurking under the hood. These include double data encryption and Onion support, NordVPN’s own CyberSec technology, a clear no-log policy and P2P support. Plenty going on, then. A real plus is the high-speed proprietary NordLynx protocol built around WireGuard – which is exclusive to Linux and iOS users. Those toting an iPhone or iPad can select NordLynx and be treated to near-unaffected connection speeds while still remaining anonymous online. We found both the iOS and Android apps slightly hindered by the choice to use the map-based location selector tool as the default view. We’d much prefer to have seen a list from the get-go, but fortunately it’s only a swipe away. Otherwise, NordVPN provides stellar mobile service, and is an especially great choice for iOS users.  Bargain VPN for your mobile Maximum devices supported: Unlimited | Play Store rating: 4.2 | App Store rating:: 4.4 Surfshark is a great option if you’re looking for one of the best value cheap VPNs around to use on your smartphone. The headline of a two-year plan for under $2.50/£2 a month is enough to draw many in, but Surfshark doesn’t scrimp on features either.  The mobile offerings are near enough indistinguishable from the easy-to-use desktop client, and include essential features like split tunnelling, plenty of server locations and a selection of protocols to choose from.  Connection speeds have proven to be stable, with Android users being treated to a choice of encryption methods, the option of using small packets to optimise mobile data use, and even a fake GPS tool to help completely spoof your location. However, for those with more devices than USB ports to charge them from, Surfshark’s unlimited connections will be indispensable – you’ll be able to stay covered on your iPhone, Samsung Galaxy S21, Microsoft Surface Go, Mac Pro, smart TV, Wi-Fi router… With a single subscription to Surfshark, you’ll be able to protect pretty much anything you own that can connect to the internet.  Cracking value with plenty of features Maximum devices supported: 10 | Play Store rating: 4.3 | App Store rating:: 4.7 Private Internet Access (also known by the abbreviated PIA) offers the basic necessities of a VPN alongside some really useful extra features – all for a great price, too. And, while the apps are pleasingly minimalist, they pack in more functionality than many desktop VPN clients. Most VPNs have stark differences between their iOS and Android offerings, but PIA’s apps are incredibly similar – good to see if you’re a user of both, or you’ve found that your device gets the raw end of the deal from other VPNs.  Both apps offer split tunnelling, protocol switching, the choice between UDP or TCP connections, the ability to use your preferred DNS and more. There’s a lot of power here. PIA also even offers their own secure browser InBrowser – but that’s also available free without purchase of the VPN. For a combination of usability, value and in-depth tuning of your VPN experience, PIA is a tempting proposition. And that's born out by how much the mobile VPN's users seem to like it - whether in the App Store or Play store, it consistently delivers excellent user ratings.  On Android or iPhone, Windscribe is a reliable mobile VPN Maximum devices supported: Unlimited | Play Store rating: 4.3 | App Store rating:: 4.6 We realise full well that it's far from the main concern, but it's clear that Windscribe gives a lot of consideration to the way its mobile VPN apps look and feel. Whether on iOS or Android, they're fantastic apps to look at and use. But this is a world away from style over substance, with Windscribe backing things up beneath the skin. WireGuard has now been rolled out across all clients and mobile apps, meaning that you can get faster connections and enhanced connection reliability. Windscribe isn't in the same echelon as others on this list when it comes to choosing a VPN for streaming, but if that's not at the top of your agenda then you'll be happy with the provider's easy menu of protocols. Features like split tunnelling and a handy Network Whitelist that automatically turns on the VPN when you hit untrusted networks are also genuinely useful added bonuses. And don't forget that Windscribe has a full free version (so not just a VPN with a free trial), letting you try before you buy. Just be wary of the data and server restrictions on that no-cost version. When looking at mobile VPN apps, there are a few things to keep in mind.  Firstly – and most importantly for the majority of users – is it easy to use? If you’re stuck three taps deep in a settings menu just to change your server, you’re not going have a good time using the app in the long term. Simplicity rules here, and all the VPNs on this list are clean and clear.  Secondly, make sure there’s enough functionality compared to the desktop client. Many VPNs offer incredibly in-depth settings on their PC VPN for Windows, but open the app and you might struggle to find options you’ve grown used to.  Many users won’t care about things like switching protocols or UDP/TCP, but if you do – or think you might ever have the urge to investigate – make sure the app is powerful enough for you.  Finally, value! There are a lot of top-quality VPNs out there now, so there’s no point paying through the nose for an average service. The very best will never be the cheapest (and free VPNs aren't an ideal solution), but weigh up your budget and your needs to find a happy medium. Protection on public Wi-Fi networks is at the top of the list. Whether you’re in a supermarket, on a train, at hospital or working away in a café, using public Wi-Fi exposes you to unencrypted connections, leaving your logins and personal information up for grabs. A mobile VPN can also help you save money shopping online. Many sites charge different prices depending on your IP address, so by moving your location around you’ll be able to find the best deals on whatever you’re looking for. Finally, everyone’s favourite trick: access geo-blocked Netflix libraries with a VPN. All the VPNs on this list can give you access to Netflix all over the world. So, wherever you are – bus, train, on the toilet – you’ll be able to watch whatever you want on your mobile device.  All you need to do is pick your choice from this list, and bask in the glory of true freedom on the internet.

Tesla rival Li Auto is on tap. Here's what to do. This super-investor says the market is due for a historic decline. It's time to listen. A massive and surprising new transition could soon impact the wealth of thousands, while leaving everyone else worse off than before. The fast-spreading strain of coronavirus roiled markets on Black Friday, raising concerns about how the economy and Wall Street may perform next week. One EV company that’s been flying under the radar, that is until it had big news at this year’s Los Angeles Auto show - is Fisker Inc. Founded and run by legendary automotive designer Henrik Fisker, unveiled the production version of its Ocean EV SUV. Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned employees the company should not spend irresponsibly in the fourth quarter delivery rush. The reason seems sensible. Finding the best biotech companies to invest in can be tricky as volatility often pockmarks the space. Clinical plans don't always come to fruiti..... The technology powering virtual reality (VR) experiences has significantly improved in recent years. This technology is powering real-world applications like virtual walkthroughs of buildings and products still on the drawing board, or collaborations with colleagues in a virtual meeting room. Facebook has made a big splash into this new \"metaverse\" by changing its name to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: FB), but that's not the only way to play this trend as an investor. The prediction is actually less wild than the one she made for Tesla — and that came true. The oldest advice in the markets is, buy low and sell high. The hardest trick in the markets is knowing how to recognize a low-cost stock that is poised to bring strong gains. It’s a trick because, in truth, low cost is a relative description. A stock can have a triple-digit price tag, and still be selling for a discount if it’s off a recent high point. The upshot is, investors looking to buy low can use sharp declines in fundamentally sound stocks as a deciding factor. Wall Street’s analysts ar Ken Langone, the co-founding billionaire of Home Depot, tells CNBC about a big problem Americans will soon face. Nvidia has warned for the first time that it is at risk of losing a $1.25bn (£950m) downpayment for the British microchip designer Arm if regulators persist in holding up the deal.

Although it's been a dud of a performer in 2021, telehealth platform Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC) is a holding I fully expect to deliver 10X (or greater) returns by the time I'm ready to enjoy retirement. While some folks would opine that Teladoc was lucky to be in the right place at the right time when the pandemic struck, I'd contend that they're not looking at the bigger picture. For instance, in the six years leading up to the pandemic, Teladoc's average annual sales grew by 74%. Generation Investment Management, chaired by former Vice President Al Gore, doubled down on Intel stock and bought more Alibaba shares in the third quarter. It also halved its position in Texas Instruments. See why these deals will sell out before the holidays. In this article, we discuss the 10 best EV charging stocks to buy now.

        "body": "These are the 4 best mobile cryptocurrency mining apps that I’ve found. They will give you free cryptocurrency tokens by remote cloud mining. The special thing about these mobile cryptocurrency mining apps is that they don’t drain your battery as traditional cryptocurrency mining does. This is because none of the cryptocurrency is being mined on your phone. You don’t need to keep the app open and you don’t need to keep your phone turned on. They will continue to mine even if you disconnect from the internet. Perhaps the greatest part is that there are no fees to use these apps and no investments need to be made. All you need to do is regularly activate the miners. I personally keep all of them together in an app folder. I activate them all at the same time when I’m waiting for the bus, or in Zoom meetings where I don’t need to pay too much attention. You can download these apps and start earning cryptocurrency to add to your portfolio today. Pi Network is my favourite of all the mobile cryptocurrency mining apps. First released in March 2019, Pi Network has grown and developed rapidly. With “Phase 3” (Mainnet) launching early 2022, Pi holders are looking forward to finally withdrawing their tokens. Although the app has been available for a long time now, it’s not too late to start. Join the Pi Network. I have high hopes for the success of Pi. Primarily due to the friendliness and openness of the Stanford core team operating it who seem to have good intentions. Pi Network has a huge userbase behind it and it is moving towards a heavily community-driven approach. To top it off, the process of activating the miner is as simple as pressing a button. Launched at the end of 2020, you can earn TIME tokens by checking your daily attendance on the app. Unlike the others on this list, TimeStope seems to be low on the radar. I started using this 2 days ago so I’m still learning how it all works. With that in mind, this is your opportunity to get in early. To be able to join TimeStope as this moment in time you need a witness, fortunately for you, I’m happy to do that! Use CozyCrypto to get access to the app. You can download TimeStope here. Also launched near the end of 2020, Bee Network has exploded in popularity, partially on the back of Pi Network’s success and userbase. At the moment it feels like a carbon-copy of Pi Network, but this may change further down the line. I’m quite happy to activate the miner alongside the others. You activate the miner once a day by pressing a button. So it’s super easy. On top of that, I have great news for you. You can get 1 free BEE token when you join if you use the code CozyCrypto. Join Bee Network here  In the past, Phoneum wasn’t too impressive. However, the team has been hard at work and their labour is paying off. PHT has been steadily increasing in price due to the number of use cases increasing. It is a fully-fledged cryptocurrency which you can withdraw. You only need to activate the miner once a week and you can stake your accrued PHT tokens for 30 days to earn even more. Start mining PHT now. Use code w44c2akj to claim a 200 PHT Bonus. I have been using this for about a year now and I’ve been adding the weekly income to the monthly staking. I started off super slow and it took months for me to build up a decent amount of PHT. However, it’s like compound interest and now the app is earning me a pretty decent income. Get your ball rolling and start earning today. I hope my post has given you a good idea of how to earn cryptocurrency using these mobile cryptocurrency mining apps on your mobile. I have been searching for good apps since early 2019 and these are some of the best I’ve found. If you liked the apps featured here and you’d like to see more of my suggestions, you can visit my complete list of the Top 12 Best Games, Apps, and Mining Tools to Earn Cryptocurrency. While I’m not convinced I’m ever going to get filthy rich from any of these. I like collecting different tokens and I like the idea of them potentially supplementing my income in the future. Yes, there is the potential that one of them could hit the moon and be like a winning lottery ticket. While it is highly unlikely, I think that spending 2-3 minutes a day, just for that possibility, is an entirely worthwhile endeavour. It should be noted that Pi and Bee are currently not on the blockchain. This means that technically they aren’t cryptocurrencies yet. However, they will be soon as they both have it stated as a key part of their roadmaps. If you enjoyed my article then let me know down below in the comments. I’m always on the lookout for new mobile cryptocurrency mining apps so let me know if you find any more. I could even add them to the list! You can also follow me on Twitter to get updated when the latest article goes live. I hope this list has been helpful to you and I wish you all the best.

        "body": "September 23, 2021 01:00 ET | Source: KBC Groep  Brussel, BELGIUM   Press release Brussels, 23 September 2021 – 7.00 a.m. CEST KBC Mobile named best mobile banking app worldwide by independent international research agency, Sia Partners. KBC Mobile tops world ranking exactly 10 years after being launched. In a comparative study1, independent international research agency, Sia Partners, has crowned KBC Mobile best mobile banking app in the world. KBC has always been among the front runners in the annual Sia survey in previous years, but ended up taking the top spot this year. This recognition is all the more important for KBC, because Sia has systematically expanded the scope of its survey in recent years. In the current survey, Sia examined no fewer than 135 banks from 17 different countries around the world, enabling the study to provide an excellent picture of the current mobile banking market and the trends that are emerging. Sia highlights various factors in its analysis of KBC Mobile, including the remarkably large number of additional third-party services, the simulation tools, full online capabilities for many types of transactions, the excellent and hassle-free user experience, connectivity (e.g., wearables, itsme, cash withdrawals at ATMs, etc.), the possibilities to interact with KBC's other physical and digital distribution channels and the central role of Kate - KBC's digital personal assistant. Sia's conclusion is clear: ‘KBC Mobile is a perfect and efficient banking app for everyday needs and one of the most innovative with some interesting extras. The app surprises customers with the wide range of functionalities and the virtual assistance by Kate.' Incidentally, the Sia report is not the only one that considers KBC to be the reference in the field of digitalisation. In a recent report, for instance, Deloitte put Kate at the top of an analysis2 of digital assistants, and last week TechPulse magazine named Kate 'Best Customer Case 2021'. Johan Thijs, KBC Group CEO, regards this top ranking as a fitting acknowledgement of all the hard work put in over the past few years: 'KBC Mobile's top worldwide position in the Sia rankings is clear recognition of 10 years of innovation, development and – in particular – carefully listening to our customers. For me, this recognition applies not just to Belgium, but also to the mobile apps we offer our customers in all our core markets. Our Pearl+ business culture ensures we continuously inspire each other in all KBC group countries to launch, realise and adopt new ideas that are a 'perfect fit' with local customer expectations. The Digital First approach we launched a year ago as the core of our strategy is clearly paying off in this regard and demonstrates the innovative strength we can harness as a group.' Transparent, sound and clear methodology used by Sia New and alternative market players are increasingly claiming their place among traditional financial service providers, while competition – strengthened by innovative and disruptive trends such as cryptocurrencies, artificial intelligence, data analysis and sustainability requirements – is becoming fiercer and fiercer. On the basis of these observations, Sia Partners examined the extent to which financial institutions can use mobile banking to respond to these challenges. The final score that Sia Partners gives to a mobile banking app is the sum of the sub-scores for functionalities offered in the app, user experience and app store ratings. The survey measured a total of more than 85 different criteria in 13 categories. Sia Partners concluded that European banks lead the way in digitalisation through their innovative services and complete end-to-end offering. The keen competitive drive among Belgium's top digital players also stimulates them to set the bar ever higher, resulting in top worldwide positions in the Sia rankings by some considerable margin. Recognition for 10 years of KBC Mobile KBC launched its first mobile banking app on 19 September 2011. Exactly 10 years on, KBC Mobile is central to the customer approach adopted by KBC and has become the reference in the market. The fact that Sia Partners has just named KBC 'digital leader' in a worldwide survey of 135 sector peers, makes this anniversary even more special. Over the past 10 years, KBC Mobile has undergone a dramatic transition, changing from an app for performing basic transactions and checking account information to a fully-fledged, customer-centric ecosystem that proactively meets increasingly more of the customer's needs. These needs are not limited to just banking, insurance and investment, they also include mobility, leisure and health matters, etc. Kate, KBC’s digital personal assistant, already plays an important role in this progress and will play an even more central role in the interaction with the customer in the months and years to come, supported by artificial intelligence and data analysis.

Mobile is indeed the future of everything, from business and healthcare app development to gaming and all-things good in between. And industry by industry insights and overall usage numbers agree. Mobile internet access has overtaken desktop internet usage big time. In 2018, more than 70 percent of all web traffic originated from mobile devices, up from 57 percent in 2017. Quartz estimated a jump of 80 percent in 2019.  Fill out the short form below or call us at (312) 600-5433      One of our consultants will get back to you within 24 hours.          Not just that, American adults are now spending an average of 3+ hours each day on their mobile gizmos browsing internet, and only 2.2 hours on a desktop computer. Mobile app development refers to the process of writing software that works on a mobile device (smartphones, tables, wearable). But app development is not only about coding a native, HTML5 or hybrid app. It is about the strategic process of defining, designing, building and launching a successful mobile product. In this article, based on our experience in building mobile apps for over ten years, you will learn everything we know about mobile app development.       We take you through every step of building a great mobile product: from ideation to market validation, persona definition to creating beautiful designs, creating a robust development architecture and writing clean code, followed by how you build a marketing plan to hit the ground running the day your app is published on the App Store. But most importantly, read this article to learn from the mistakes of many app builders, investors and entrepreneurs. Building a great app isn’t cheap. We’ve seen people waste millions, literally, on building bad products or launching poorly designed apps. Don’t be that person. Take the time to read this article, beginning to end, to make sure you build the best possible app that will do justice to your amazing idea.  In 2019, there were more than 5.11 billion unique mobile users, accounting for over 90 percent of all global internet users. According to the State of Mobile 2019 report by App Annie, global app downloads reached 194 billion in 2018, with consumers spending a whopping $101 billion on app stores. In fact, companies leveraging mobile capabilities enjoyed a staggering 360 % higher IPO valuation in 2018. The worldwide mobile app economy is expected to hit $6.3 trillion by 2021, and app revenue is expected to experience an uptick of 113 percent to reach $188 billion. The worldwide mobile app economy is expected to hit $6.3 trillion by 2021 CLICK TO TWEET These numbers are loud and clear: it’s time you join the mobile app development train. After all, most likely, your competitors are already doing it. On the other hand, research from Gartner estimates that fewer than 0.01% of apps were considered a financial success in 2018. With an average investment of $270,000 to design, build and launch an app, it's not a small project by anyone's standards. But the stark reality is that most mobile apps fail. So, it is very important to be clear about the strategy, plan and execution before committing time, money and resources to building an app.  This might be a hard pill to swallow, but it’s true, nonetheless. Out of every 10,000 mobile apps developed, only 1 will triumph while the other 9,999 will go puff into oblivion. As an entrepreneur, this means that the odds are greatly stacked against you. But don’t let this big number bog you down. It is only ill-planned and ill-executed apps that are set to fail from the first day. That’s why you need to learn why apps fail in the first place. After all, why not learn from failures of others so you do not repeat the same mistakes? No matter how you look at it, mobile app development is all about arming yourself with industry knowledge and having a solid go-to-market plan & strategy. It’s a prudent way to safeguard your app from becoming part of the 99.99 percent. With that being said, here are the four key areas that make mobile apps fail. As a forward-thinking entrepreneur, it is critical to consider these pitfall areas as a wake-up call. And, more importantly, you need to find ways to turn them into positives.  Every successful product - no matter what it does, whom it is designed for or who created it - begins with a great strategy. The same goes for a mobile app. Mobile App Strategy refers to the creative effort required to translate consumers’ needs into an app that can be used seamlessly to accomplish a specific task. The goal of a mobile strategy is simple: to help a user 'do something', quickly and effectively, every time a mobile app can fulfill that user's need.  Without a well-designed, researched and implemented strategy at every level of development, your app is poised to go down the drain. This is especially true if you are trying to get your feet wet in a new or an upcoming niche/industry. That’s why it comes as no big surprise that a poor move at the strategy level is one of the key areas where most apps fail. Of course, there are more specific reasons why mobile apps fail at this planning phase:  How much do you know about your target market and the end user of your mobile app? If your app does not address a market need or problem, then it will not get downloaded and, if it does end up on a user’s phone, it might not be used. According to a report by SAP, close to 80 percent of mobile apps end up being abandoned just after their first use. Why? You guessed it right: they aren’t a good fit for the user, and lack a stellar mobile app strategy. Considering the big bets everyone is placing on mobile, poor market research can quickly turn into a nightmare and lead to disappointment. That’s why you need to kick off your app development journey with a thorough user/market research. In other words, what solution will your app provide that your specific target audience needs? Market research makes it imperative that you clearly define your target audience, and investigate further about them. What’s their core problems, needs, interests, and pain-points? By learning the ins and outs of the market, as well as getting an in-depth understanding of your specific users, you will most likely create an app that is tailored to what they are actually looking for. But your market research doesn’t have to stop there. Due diligence on your closest rivals can also come in handy. Do a win-loss juxtapositioning, and comprehensive competitor analysis to better inform your mobile strategy. When all is said and done, your market research should act as a means of connecting your app idea with your target audience. And this should be your step #1 and an overarching aspect of your mobile app development at all stages.  This one is a no-brainer, and yet it is still one of the most common reasons why mobile apps fail at the strategy level. If you don’t plan the execution stages in detail, your app will most likely flop. For instance, how are you planning to let your target users know about your new app? Do you have plans in place for app-install campaigns? Proper planning includes marketing and ranking factors like ASO, SEO, PR push, and so forth. If you neglect them until the last minute, you will be caught in the motions of trying to execute an app that has low to zero buzz. Even worse, you’ll have no avenue of getting preliminary user feedback and therefore can’t get your app truly ready for the market. We’ve actually written the playbook on adequate app launching techniques. Read: The 2021 Mobile App Marketing Guide with 25 Pro Tips  Goal-setting is a paramount step in the strategy and planning phase of your app creation. If you don’t hammer out clearly defined objectives, your app is set up to fail right from the outset. They are important in the grand scheme of things, especially when it comes to marketing your mobile. With clearly defined goals on hand, you will easily map out your strategy on how to get there. When working on defining your goals, you need to ask yourself the following tough and important questions:  App developers are also faced with myriads of pitfalls during the design and software development phase. These failures and design issues can stall your mobile strategy even before your app makes it to launch date. They include but not limited to: Mobile app design refers to the process of ideating, defining, planning and building the user experience seen by a smartphone user while interacting with a mobile app. Mobile app design combines visual (colors, photography, animations) and graphical elements (topography, font, writing) into a unified user experience. When executed correctly, a user will NEVER thing of the mobile design of an app. They would only think about how easy it is to accomplish a certain task on a specific app. Great design = happy customers. When done poorly, users have only jarring things to say about apps with bad design. They will ditch your poorly designed app in the first crucial 8 seconds, and you’ll never see them again. That’s the harsh reality of app design. While there are many elements that make for a pleasant user experience, at the very minimum, your app should be easy and intuitive to use. If users have a hard time finding or using some of the fundamental features/functions of your app, you have little to no chance of keeping them. The design is what the user sees when interacting with your app. But overall poor app usability can result from a number of other things like tediously long and complex sign-up process; lagging, slow or buggy features that affect the overall performance of the app; inaccessible features, and painfully long load times. When one or more of these issues come together, your mobile app will fail. You need to take care of user experience issues during the design and software development stage. Another trick is to have the app tested for usability right from its infancy so that you can go back to the drawing board as many times as you can, make necessary refinements, and by the launch date, your app will optimally user-friendly. Not all mobile app development agencies are created equal. If your team isn’t up to date with the latest development standards, your app might not see the light of the day, or worse, it may be launched and never get any active users. The same goes for developers who use substandard coding methods. The bottom line is that bad technology has no room in app creation. That’s why you need to work with a team that stays on top of the latest app development best practices. Conducting several QA tests throughout the creation of your app will help you deliver a product that’s bug-free and user-friendly. Unfortunately, it’s hard to tell right from day 1 how much time you will require to test your app for quality, and what the QA test itself will entail. Smart mobile developers usually take plenty of time to thoroughly QA test the app, which might end up costing more and consuming more time. However, not QA-testing your mobile app comes with dire consequences. And skipping the testing altogether is often the reason why some apps go to rack and ruin. So you have come up with a great mobile app strategy and plan. It’s now time to execute the plan. Before we show you how to do it successfully, there are still some potential app-killing problems and failures lurking around the corner. These include:  There are over 2.2 million apps in the App Store alone, with another 2.6 million populating Google Play. There are thousands more entering the fray on a daily basis, not to mention that some apps are not listed on these two app marketplaces. No matter how you look at it, you have some serious competition up ahead. If you don’t have an original idea or offer something appealing to your target audience, your app won’t cut it. And so we are clear, a mobile app can succeed even if there’s a lot of other players in the field. You just need to have a unique value proposition, even if the core functionality of your digital product is similar to others. The example I always give is this. LivingSocial was launched in 2007 and became the biggest deals website in the world, once worth 6 billion dollars and considering an IPO. In November 2008, Groupon was launched with an identical business model. Even the two competitor websites did not truly differentiate themselves that much, outside of basic visual elements like colors and topography. Yet, what Groupon understood better than anyone else was the power of compelling content. They double-down and invested heavily in professional copywriters, recruiting every gifted writer they could find to provide deals listings that were compelling, funny, and long. They were the first e-commerce site to understand, even before Amazon, the power of long-form copy. Fast forward to 2016 - Groupon buys LivingSocial for pennies on the dollar. Today, Groupon leads the market despite competing with other 600 daily deals sites. Moral of the story. You can absolutely disrupt a crowded market. But you need to do one thing better than everyone else. And that comes from thoroughly studying your competitors.  There’s a good chance that you are building your app with a partner or with the help of a team. Either, you should expect some sort of conflicting priorities from some key members. If your team of developers breaks down, the road ahead will be a tough one and your will app will likely flop. When you move forward with building a mobile app, you need to make sure you do it with people you can trust. Because there will be conflicts. And you need to be able to work well with those you choose to build an app with. At Digital Authority Partners, the most successful app we’ve ever worked was led by two brothers with incredibly complementary personalities. There were many issues along the way, by they sorted them all out and the app is now worth a bit over $50 million (and we continue to work with them!). This isn’t to say you should only build an app with members of your family. It simply means you need to build it with people you can trust and who will be there when times are tough or when you’re dealing with a lot of uncertainty.  Monetization woes cause most apps to fail. After all, if you don’t have a well-defined road to profitability, your mobile app will sooner or later fail. Good thing, there are plenty of ways to monetize your creation. You can run paid ads, offer paid subscriptions, provide in-app purchases/features or drive users to your e-commerce store/website. Whatever it is, make sure to have a definite road-to-profitability strategy right from the outset. This will make your execution-level progress without any hitch.  Your app will cost money to plan, design, develop, launch, market … the whole shebang. If you run out of cash at the beginning, in the middle or even near the end, you are in for a big surprise. Even after building and launching your app, you still need some money to tide your company over until profitability. That’s why it is important to have a conservative budget that’s well planned and generously funded. Here’s a real life example. A client of ours spend 1 million on building an app. Thenthey came to us to market it. But they completely missed the market. He tried riding on the hype of mobile app development, without proper market research. In his industry, the majority of people using an app, did so to research the topic at hand, NOT to buy. The client went against our advice and launched the app. It tanked. He then scrambled to find money to build a website. Eventually he did. But then he ran out of money to market the product. The rule of thumb any investor will tell you is this: whatever your budget is, reserve 30% of it to marketing and growing your app. I would say 90% of our clients fail to do that and then they launch a great product but fail to market it adequately. The lucky ones secure funding from investors and they course correct the ship. The unlucky ones abandon the project. Always plan for a robust marketing budget or you won’t be able to take an app to the next stage.  You have built an incredible app that’s capable of raking in money. That’s all good and dandy, but if you don’t market it rigorously and offer effective support, it might still fail. Typical app marketing failures that you need to avoid include: You should have a crystal-clear marketing message for your app. Your marketing message, most notably the description copy, should tell your app story, highlight its best features, and how it stands out from the crowd. If your marketing message isn’t clear enough, users will move on to the next app, leaving you high and dry. How to keep your marketing message on the up-and-up? If you are interested in mobile app marketing, you may also want to check out our comprehensive guide titled: A Step by Step Guide for Driving Android App Downloads It is customary for users to dig into reviews and check out user ratings before downloading a mobile app. It makes sense because why would you want to download an app that hasn’t been tried, tested, and rated? This can be particularly painful if your app is competing with other apps with lots of ratings and reviews. Having many poor reviews and bad ratings can do you more harm than good. It is not even uncommon for some apps to fail just because they could not garner enough ratings quick enough. To avoid this, start your app-install campaigns on a high gear and don’t be afraid to ask for reviews/ratings and make sure you have features that encourage users to share the app with their friends and family, rate your app in the app store and more. Your app needs to pop up in a crowd. It needs to differentiate itself from those of your rivals. If it is just another run-of-the-mill app on the market, you will be put in the back burner. The same is true for unclear branding. If you don’t have a well-defined and stand-out brand, your app will be at risk of failure. As such, you need to polish your app’s brand by defining your core values and principles that differentiate you from your rivals.

Now that we’ve walked you through the main reasons why mobile apps fail, you may even be inclined to ask yourself: should I even build an app? If you just look at the high costs and low success rates you may feel discouraged. So, why even build an app? There are plenty of reasons. Here are some of the top ones: In the digital age and era of instant-everything, the case for developing an app for your business is strong, but knowing that it will help you increase sales makes it even more appealing. Developing a well-designed and user-friendly mobile app allows businesses to digitize their services and make them readily available on any mobile device. If you own a brick-and-mortar or e-commerce store, for instance; it is a no-brainer to build a mobile store app. The app will provide you with yet another direct marketing channel. It would allows allow you to run geo-location based campaigns. Check out Sephora for example. They’ve built a companion app which users can take advantage off while inside the store. The app shows them past purchase history, provides product recommendations, limited offers only available on the mobile app and a lot more. Other companies use mobile apps to show in-store price information, product descriptions, user accounts, feedback functionality, search filters, and so much more. However, nothing beats the fact that you can make your app a great place for users to find sales, promos, discounts, and other exciting offers. They’ll all be right there at their fingertips. When it comes to using a mobile app to improve sales, numbers don’t lie: a mobile app is a great sales tool. The number of unique mobile users has increased from 122.9 million in 2013 to close to 200 million at the end of 2018. Even better, mobile apps enjoy a 3x and 1.5x higher conversion rates than mobile websites and desktop respectively. mobile apps enjoy a 3x and 1.5x higher conversion rates than mobile websites and desktop respectively. CLICK TO TWEET Mobile app users tend to view 4.6x more products than browsers of mobile websites. Talking of sales value, the average order value of mobile apps is 140 percent higher than mobile sites and 130 percent higher than desktop websites. That being said, not having a mobile app could be hurting your sales. Given that mobile app users spend 2x as shoppers who make their shopping on mobile or desktop websites, this provides you with yet another chance to make more sales. And you don't want to ignore the fact that 19 percent of all online retail sales in the United States are made on a mobile device.  Customers are now interested in immersive experiences more than ever before, especially when they are shopping. They want to feel valued and appreciated. More importantly, they want to know that the brand behind a service or product is worthy of their money and attention. That’s where a well-defined mobile app strategy can come into the picture. There are a ton of reasons why mobile apps do a bang-up job when it comes to enhancing overall customer experience. Let’s look at a few ways mobile redefines how brands provide added-value to their users through amazing mobile app strategies. A mobile app makes it possible to provide the customer with a seamless shopping experience. The purchasing process can be made effortless by using one-click payment options, SMS confirmations, push notifications, and other mobile elements that will deliver a best-in-class customer experience. Mobile apps allow for next-level personaliz ation. Delivering a top-notch customer experience is all about personalization. This can be achieved by engaging the user throughout the purchasing process. Loyalty perks: loyalty benefits like cash back, discounts, freebies, special promo codes, and flash sales are what make for great customer experience. All of these can be achieved with greater outcomes on a mobile app, encouraging the customer to keep coming back. Running a loyalty program easy and hassle-free on an app. Leverage push notifications to the fullest extent allowed: this is the little-known secret to boosting user and customer experience using mobile apps. However, you don’t want to bombard the user with constant pop-ups and push notifications. They can be annoying and might coerce the user to uninstall your app. Relevant push notifications can revolutionize how engaged users are with your brand. And don’t forget - push notifications are clicked on (technically tapped on) more than ANY other channel. The click through rate for push notifications is 7.9% according to a recent study based on notifications sent to 900 million users. 65% of all small businesses (including your competitors) have already built a mobile app. Why would you want to be left behind in an increasingly competitive business environment? Mobile app development gives you a chance to either stay ahead of the curve (read: your slow-to-mobile competitors) or catch up with those who already have an app. It is always an excellent idea to have every potential strategy in your marketing toolkit - and having a mobile app is a good addition. The odds are that you are struggling to show ROI for your email marketing, paid ads, TV ads, print, and other digital marketing channels. Building an app helps you create a direct marketing channel. It’s, therefore, a strategy that will pay for itself sooner than later.  Having a mobile-ready site used to be enough to keep mobile users engaged. That’s no longer the case. You need a mobile app to provide users with better engagement and communication avenues. It doesn’t matter what you are products or services are, your customers must have an effective way of getting in touch with you. That’s exactly what a mobile app can offer. Incorporate a help desk, feedback or live chat feature within your mobile app. These features can make a huge difference in the way your business interacts, connects and communicates with the customer. A customer-centric mobile app is a phone, text messaging app, email, and chat box, all rolled into one.  If done right, an app can do wonders for your company’s brand awareness. Remember that your app is much akin to an empty billboard sign. You can perk it up with educative content, make it stylish or engaging. Whatever the case, you want your app to be something that users will love and cherish. But, more crucially, make sure that your mobile app is superbly designed, stunning-looking, and well branded. A good app can also take your recognition to a whole new and exciting level. The more your app gets used and downloaded, the more familiar your brand/products/services will become among your ideal customers. In the ad world, this what is known as “effective frequency.” As a rule of thumb, if the users can see your product or interact with your brand more than 20x, they will become easily recognizable to them. As a rule of thumb, if the users can see your product or interact with your brand more than 20x, they will become easily recognizable to them. CLICK TO TWEET So far in this article, we’ve talked about why apps fail and why you should build a mobile app. We chose this structure because I am a firm believer that this is how you should approach building an app. First - understand why others have failed. When the knowledge on what causes failure, you are more likely to avoid it. I’ve built Digital Authority Partners from scratch with only two people around the dinner table. Along the way, I’ve made a lot of mistakes. Many of these mistakes would have been avoidable if I had known the pitfalls of running an agency. I didn’t know them - very few agency owners talk about lessons learned - so i had to make these mistakes on my own and then learn from it. The first section of this article is nothing more than a collection of failures we have seen first-hand with many of our clients. Learn from them - and avoid them if you can. Second - I walked you through the benefits of building an app. How an app can improve your bottom line is critical to your success. You don’t build an app just because everyone else does it. You build an app because mobile is a channel that can attract new customers, improve your relationship with your current customers or it improves your operational efficiency. Before you build an app - you need to answer that for yourself: which customer-centric key performance indicator will my app address? What is my desired reach in terms of current and potential customers? And will my app be better than the apps of all my competitors? Armed with this knowledge, you can now begin the process of really immersing yourself in the twelve steps outlined below which all successful apps have in common! Let’s get to them.  Your app shouldn’t be an exact copy of your website or e-commerce store. It should offer much more than information and run-of-the-mill features to the user. That’s because of a simple reality. Downloading an app is, dare I say, an intimate act. As a user, you take the time to download an app on your most personal device in hopes it can produce value to yourself in the long term. There’s nothing more personal than that! Because getting an app download isn’t easy, you need to create a unique, simple and compelling value proposition for your new digital product. A well-executed value proposition is what makes your app stand out in a sea of choice. How is your app different from other similar apps? What are the benefits that your app will bring to users? How will the app make the lives of the user better, more enjoyable, etc? You need to hold a brainstorming session with your partners or strategic consulting team to come up with your unique value proposition. Not just that, you should write down exactly how your app will solve a specific problem, then move on to brainstorm about what makes your brand unique, who your target market is, and how you will position your app in the market to maximize downloads and engagement rates. Your value proposition statement should also touch on your niche and how you stack up against competitors. While it might sound like it, your Unique Value Proposition (UVP) is not a statement, a catchphrase or a catchy slogan for your app. The UVP must clearly and concisely describe what customers get out of using your app that they won’t get through any other channels. There are 4 core attributes of an amazing unique value proposition: Still a little hazy? Here are some of the UVPs that will drive the point and truly inspire yours: Let’s start with coffeeshop giant, Starbucks. Their customers can use the Starbucks app to pay in the store, earn stars or even order ahead of getting to the store. This way, they can skip the line (phew! Have you seen Starbucks line in the morning?) This is an incredible value to the customer because the app helps them save at least 15 minutes of their busy mornings. Wouldn’t you install such a time-saving app? The benefit to Starbucks is two-prong : (1) it encourages more app installs, and (2) increases foot traffic to their locations. Another wonderful example is Uber. “Tap the app, get a ride”. The value proposition here is providing customers with extreme convenience. The name of the app - uber - in and of itself communicates much of their value proposition. Why does it win? First, the app makes it possible for a user to get a rideshare with one tap. Second, payment for the ride is cashless and only takes one tap. And, thirdly, the driver already knows where you are heading two. That’s like killing three birds with one stone! Bumble \"On Bumble, ladies always go first\" is a real class act. Why? It proposes a fresh approach to online dating, away from the popular “swipe right” or “swipe left.” Secondly, the app empowers its target customer, the millennial lady. Most importantly, it touches on the app user’s pain point, which in this case, is an online dating world that’s dominated by men.  SWOT analysis is a strategic planning session designed to help any company or entrepreneur identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats tied to a specific business idea. The goal of a SWOT analysis is to uncover “unexpected” surprises tied to a project before you invest lots of time and money in it. Performing a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities & Threats) before creating a mobile app is a crucial step. Unfortunately, 99% of app makers never bother with this. SWOT helps you validate the concept first - before you spend money, effort and time on it. As such it is the most important step to prevent that big ‘Only if I had known earlier’ moment later. How does SWOT analysis help you achieve better mobile app development outcomes? It should be noted that a SWOT analysis doesn’t actually offer a true solution to what app exactly you should build. Nonetheless, it helps you find and analyze the overarching problems affecting your mobile strategy or idea. Strengths - By understanding the strengths of your mobile app idea, you can answer important questions about your strategy. What are the key benefits that your app will deliver to your ideal users? Will it eventually lead to a sale or an action that will improve your bottom-line? How is your app better than your competitors? What your app’s unique appeal? Weaknesses - This encompasses limitations and hurdles that put your app at a disadvantage on the market. However, the analysis should help you identify these weak points so you can devise ways of turning them into advantages. By engaging in this step, you can anticipate failures and plan how to avoid them accordingly. Opportunities - Take a close look and your strengths and weaknesses, and think how you can transform them into improvements and new opportunities. The good news is that opportunities in the mobile app development are a dime a dozen. Think about: what are your competitor's weaknesses that you can exploit? What's trending in another niche that you can duplicate the success in your own niche? Threats - When developing a successful app, you must be able to deter any threat. That’s why this phase of the SWOT analysis is all-important. To identify your potential threats, ask yourself these crucial questions: How do your rivals deter their threats? Is your app prepared to take on challenges brought about by technology changes, market shifts, and changes in consumer behavior? You must also invest in market research before spending a large amount of time and money in building an app. Is the market ready? Who are the top competitors? What are the threats? Great market research not only educates one about the state of the market but also sheds light on hidden opportunities that others may not have looked at. Once the market data is in, start planning a course of action  Fill out the short form below or call us at (312) 600-5433      One of our consultants will get back to you within 24 hours.           Setting well-defined goals is an indispensable part of the mobile app development journey. It is at this point that you will set your priorities and determine a clear course of action for the next several weeks or months. These goals will tell you where you are currently, where you want to be and how to get there. What are the primary goals of your mobile app? How do you know if the goals you are setting are the right ones? Here are a few tips that might come in handy when outlining your mobile app development goals. First, list the three or four most important ways your ideal users will interact with your app. Make sure these goals are SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound) and in line with your overall business objectives. Second, spend half a day brainstorming the actions that users will perform within the app at launch. Through this exercise, your goal is to map out what the user journey is within the app, the primary use-cases and what you want your ideal users to achieve when they interact with your product. Examples of these actions would be defining the registration process (or lack of!), the primary action you want the user to take within the app, high level notifications strategy, whether a user will use a geolocation feature or not etc. Next up, you have to define the KPIs to measure the success of these goals. In simple terms, what actions will users take within the app that you will consider a success? This could be things like making a purchase, completing a task, returning to the app X times during a specific time period, engage with your content. Here’s a simple formula to follow: ‘My ideal customer will do this task, so many times during the week. If that happens, this app is a success.” In addition, you need to define specific metrics you need to track. Let’s take a specific example. Say you are an online shop and have launched a mobile app. Yes, you’ll want to track conversion rates (how many purchases are made through the app). But there’s a LOT of other metrics out there you should also track. Things like: How often do people use the app? How many app visits until a purchase is made? When do people abandon your app? How many people download the app but don’t register? What’s my app churn rate (people who don’t use the app over a period of time)? There’s an endless supply of questions - and analytics - you need to track users’ actions and collect data about their behavior inside your app. Other standard KPIs include app open rate, uninstalls, session rates, monthly active users (MAU), daily active users (DAU), number of unique new users, daily/monthly downloads, session length, and so forth. Lastly but not least, take a peek over the fence. Take a closer look at the great mobile app in the market (preferably within your niche), and learn what and how they do things well. Here’s a simple example of a task we do during the discovery process at Digital Authority Partners when we get a new customer who wants to build an app. We simply identify the main competitors and then have an analysts review 50-100 app reviews for each competitor. We then create a report which shows what competitors do well, what they don’t do at all and what they can improve on. That report is then used to define the set of features our client should include in their new app. Once you have documented the primary goals of your app, start defining the primary use cases for your new app. Use cases are great for user engagement and overall usability. Don’t try to define EVERY single use case imaginable. Start with the primary goals only. Let’s take the Starbucks mobile app as an example. The primary use cases for the Starbucks app are the following: Of course, the Starbucks app does a LOT more than this (see purchase history, listen to Spotify playlists curated by Starbucks, see rewards history, learn about new Starbucks drinks, add money to their app, manage gift cards, find stores, receive/ buy Starbucks cards as gifts etc). But what’s important to realize is that the primary use cases outlined above are clear, actionable, easy to understand. And all other features are built to support the primary purchasing experience. That said, do not clutter the app with everything for everyone. Rather, build it for a specific set of use cases meant for a specific group of people and perfect those. Here’s the holy grail behind expert mobile app development initiatives. You build an app which your ideal users can make a mental connection to, a connection that is simple and memorable. Practically, you want a user to think this: ‘I go to this app to do this one thing, any time I need it.’  The most successful apps ALL do this. I go to Candy Crash to decompress for a few minutes. I go to Uber to get a ride. I go to Amazon to buy stuff. I go to Snapseed to quickly edit my photos. I go to Grubhub to order good. I go to Facebook to see what my friends are up to. I go to TikTok to see some super short videos and have fun. Do you see how a mental connection is made, in my mind, in relation to the apps mentioned above? And guess what - all these apps have tens of millions of users. Because they’ve successfully created a mental association between one task and their app. And everything else builds on top of that primary use case! So apply this recipe to your own mobile app. Determine which users will be your primary audience and solve one primary problem they may have. Additionally, invest time in creating app user segmentation. In other words, various users will do different things within your app based on their motivation, frequency of using the app and a LOT of other factors.   A unique article can be created only on the topic of app user segmentation. That’s not the point of the current article. So look at the various user app segmentation as being just a quick way to look at users and by no means, a comprehensive list. App segmentation is one of the primary strategies tied to mobile app analytics. If you are interested in the topic of app analytics, you can also check out the other resources we’ve put together over time. User Experience Optimization Through A/B and Multivariate Testing The 2021 Mobile App Marketing Guide with 25 Pro Tips And you can also check out the Analytics Services Page from Digital Authority Partners here. It must also be noted that app segmentation is not something that can ‘happen’ overnight or something that is typically an out of the box functionality. Instead, companies and entrepreneurs need to leverage analytics solutions that can collect and report on these metrics. Digital Authority Partners is a certified partner for analytics solutions like Mixpanel (see our joint press release here) and Amplitude. In the meantime, here are four standard metrics tied to app user segmentation you should keep a close eye on: You can segment users based on device details such as the type (tablet, smartphone, etc), OS version (iOS, Android or Windows), and the type of hardware (Samsung S10, iPhone XS, etc.) This is a crucial segmentation criteria because user experience and app engagement rates typically vary from device to device. This is a no-brainer segmentation approach. You’d want to drill down on your users’ behavior based on their geographical information like country, city, town, zip code area, state, and so forth. This is will be especially useful if you intend to offer location-specific features and functionalities. Who's your app's audience? How'd you categorize them on available information? Are they attendees, visitors, employees, consumers, members, fans, leads, partners, B2B clients, B2C customers, etc. Don't just stop there. Specific app usage information like language setting, use frequency, if they have enable push notification, etc can come in handy when segmenting global audience. How users interact with your app should be at the core of your mobile app strategy. What is the average session duration for your users? How many days does the user take between opening, making a purchase, etc.? What do users tap on within your app? How long does it take until a user converts? How do users react when you release updates to your app? Better user segmentation translates into a better app and better marketing strategy. Think of this section as planning how to engage users. There will be another section on how to actually engage them. The questions above, by no means exhaustive when it comes to app analytics, related to specific tangible behaviors user can exhibit within an app. Asking these - and many other questions - upfront and setting us the right tracking to turn data into insights is absolutely mandatory if you want your app to succeed.  An app cannot succeed unless it becomes self-sustaining. And to become self-sustaining, it needs to make money. So, the bigger question is: how will you monetize your app when most users are used to free apps? A proper monetization model is critical to ensure the long term longevity of the app. When all is said and done, however, your monetization strategy should take two things into consideration: Here at Digital Authority Partners, we rarely advise clients to force users to pay to download the app. This model MAY work for some games, but it rarely works for everyone else. Creating a sound monetization strategy is a fine balancing act to ensure the app makes optimal revenue while not pushing away potential users by becoming too expensive. With that said, there are several different monetization models you can adopt. The most common and revenue-generating models include: Let’s face it; paid downloads is a monetization approach that only works for highly sought-after mobile apps. The idea behind this model is pretty simple and straightforward: whenever a user downloads your app, they will part with a fee which is often upfront or paid after a free trial period ends. This is the easiest and the least complicated way to earn from your sweat. After all, the higher the fee and the more the paid downloads made, the more your app revenue. Needless to say, pricing the app wrongly can impact negatively on the number of downloads and hence revenue. Check out this report from Forbes. It may be a bit outdated, but I really doubt things have changed much. According to this 2013 analysis of paid apps (those you need to pay for BEFORE downloading it), the average total revenue per app on Android is $1,125 and for iOS is $4,000. In contrast, check out this report regarding revenue from Candy Crush, one of the top freemium apps in the world. Candy Crush is free for all to play but they charge for upgrades and special powers. They made 1 billion dollar in 2018. To put this in perspective, in the paid app report above, all Android developers in 2013 made a combined 900 million in revenue. Last year, one single app, Candy Crush, made more money through a freemium model than ALL Android developers. Freemium model is ALWAYS preferred.  This is the go-to monetization model for most app developers, and with good reason. In-app ad revenue is a great way to keep your app free for the users and still remain afloat. You just to be careful about what types of ads you run in your app. Generally, there are 3 types of in-app ads for generating revenue: (1) Cost per Action (CPA), Cost per Click (CPC) and Cost per Thousand Impression (CPM). If you are looking for UX-friendly ad type, go for CPM. While the revenue tends to be on the lower end, CPM ads are usually less intrusive and not annoying, offering a better user experience. You can choose to run native ads, banner ads, interstitials or list ads. Whatever your choice, stay away from lewd, irrelevant or low-quality ads that will paint your app in a bad light. Here’s an example of an app which has implemented an ad revenue model BETTER than any app I currently use.  It is a puzzle game called Two Dots. Two dots, in many ways is similar to Candy Crush and all Candy Crush wannabes. Occasionally (definitely not every time!) before the beginning of a specific level I get this message: I’m referring to the message which says: ‘watch a video for a free Booster Box!’ If I tap on that button, I have to watch an annoying ad, usually less than 30 seconds, but I get a power-up. I’ve probably watch hundreds of these short ads so far. As a user, I get something tangible out of this. As a company, Two Dots likely makes 5-10 cents of me. It’s not huge revenue, but they are making money. According to one estimate, Two Dots makes ~700k / month through this model and through the in-app purchase options.  An ad seen on the app called Browser which allows users to surf the internet in private mode and download any video from youtube and other video storage websites. Every time a user returns to the app, an ad is played as seen in this screenshot. This monetization model usually goes hand in hand with the in-app ad model. The freemium model is simple. A user can download a mobile app for free but the user would see ads interrupting their experience from time to time. You can happily get rid of the ads in their apps for a small fee. If you intend to go down this road, you will have to create at least two versions of your app. First one will feature ads and free to use. The other one will be a paid version that’s free of ads (this is what developers call a premium app).  Above, a screenshot of in-app purchase options for Candy Crush Saga In-app purchases account for the biggest portion of app revenue. In fact, it accounts for around 47 percent of the worldwide revenue generated from apps. The good thing is that the in-app purchase feature can be incorporated with other monetization models like paid downloads, in-app ads, etc. Joining an affiliate program to promote network products, services or solutions is yet another great way to monetize your app. There are plenty of credible app affiliate programs run by companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Google. These are usually the ones that’ll pay you handsome money to promote an array of apps, but there are smaller affiliate programs you can join and rake in some income too. The idea behind this monetization model is that you’ll earn a recurring commission when the user takes an action. If one or more monetization approaches deliver good results, why not combine the best of their worlds? That’s right; you can create a hybrid monetization strategy that may bring revenue-generating ways like in-app purchases, mobile marketing automation, freemium features, affiliation and so forth under one roof. Parting Shot: building a free app might be an amazing idea because the long-term ROI would be incredibly high. That said, you need to plan to stay afloat before the app becomes profitable and it is equally important that you have a strong marketing strategy and budget right from day one.  Once you’ve decided your ideal target audience, outlined the overall mobile app strategy and decided on a robust monetization model and analytics framework, the real fun is about to begin. You are now in a position to make tactical yet incredibly powerful decisions around actually building the app. When you are ready to get down to business, you ought to plan for the quickest turnaround possible. That’s why determining the framework and planning your app make for the most important steps in the mobile app development process. There are several basic steps to doing so: Right from the start, you have to decide if you are going to build an Android app only, iOS app only, Windows app only, two or all three. Hint, virtually no one build a Windows app anymore. The kind of platform you are building the app for will determine several elements of your final product, including features to include, how to optimize user experiences, how to monetize, and how to structure your pre-launch marketing campaigns. Your use cases will also determine which kind of app you will need to build. For example, what if you are an e-commerce store? It’s a smart move to build apps for at least iOS and Android to cater to the largest percentage of the smartphone user population.  You’ll also have to decide if your app will be native, 3rd-party, carrier-specific or hybrid. This decision will have a huge bearing on the number and the type of functionality you will eventually incorporate into your app. Hybrid versus native is a discussion for another time and it fully deserves its own article. However, high level, here’s the main differences. Native apps are faster (better performance) and easier to discover in the app store. They can fully leverage a smartphone’s native features (geo-location, camera, address book etc) and easily work in an offline mode (when you lose reception). That said, they’re more expensive because they have completely different code bases between iOS and Android. They have better security and better user experience. Hybrid apps are cheaper to build, leverage one code base across iOS and Android but continue to have difficulties fully leveraging native components on a smartphone. On the other hand, the time to market is significantly faster to make. There’s a lot of pros and cons to both approaches and it all comes down to one thing: what’s the most important key performance indicator when you’re launching the app to market. That should drive the decision on what kind of app to build. At this stage, you should brainstorm with your team on the array of mobile app development technologies that will be leveraged to build your app. This way, you can plan the technology stack that will ensure maximum return on investment while an eye on the future. While SDK tools offered by app stores might come in handy, they can be a little restrictive which is why you need to think about a set of scalable technology that will allow you to build a seamless app for all target devices and platforms. How will they help integrate your app with both public and private cloud servers? But most importantly, the technology stack is the backbone of your entire app because everything else you will build for this app will fall on the decisions made when choosing the tech stack. Having a great team here cannot be underestimated. This is actually where we see most issues with clients who come to us asking for a ‘quick fix’ for their app. Code codes that look like spaghetti code, complex and unsustainable APIs. Great technology stacks and app architectures are neatly organized, well built and modular. Horrible tech stacks are convoluted, make no sense and have no documentation you can reference when trying to make sense of it. So take the time and work with a development team that understand app architecture well. Trust me, if you don’t, you will pay tenfold later.   What sets of data do you plan to collect when the app hits the App Store? Remember, no app can be a do-all solution. That’s why you need to know which data will be made available through your app right off the bat. After all, including too much data into a single app can be a huge mistake in terms of sustenance, functionality, and user experience. They can be especially hard to navigate and security a diversity of user-provided data can also become quite tricky. In addition, it’s not enough to know which data will be available on your app, you will have to decide how you will protect and leverage this information in your crucial business decisions and app improvement. Have a data handling strategy planned right out of the block.  When it comes to mobile app development, you are only as good as the team around you. That’s why it is very important to round up a team of top-notch app designers, developers, strategists, and other key experts who will ensure your product will not only stand out but also take the market by storm. The right team can make, while the wrong team will break it. Remember that people are key to mobile app development. Most importantly, you need to collaborate and hire people who know what they are doing. Who to include in your team? There are some positions that are indispensable when it comes to developing a killer app. At a minimum, your team should include talented mobile developers to code, product managers to lead the way for the team and drive the vision/strategy of the app into reality, and designers to create the app's UI and spruce up the UX. That being said, here are some factors that will help you zero in on team members who will certainly do a bang-up job:  Choose the people with the right skills that will position the app for a long time success. While there are myriads of skills that make for a great app development team, here are the topmost ones to keep in mind: UX/UI - User experience and user interface are two key elements will wow and amaze your users or disappoint them - usually, there’s very little in between. If the UI and UX of your app are shoddy, you will definitely have a tough time finding or retaining users. That's why you need team members who are UX/UI-focused. The people who know what it takes to craft a truly user-friendly app. Product management - This is a skill that will help transform your ideas into an incredibly lovable app. This member will act as a liaison between all the stakeholders involved in building the app, the proverbial jack of all traders. A development team without a product manager will falter along the way when issues like conflicts of interest, changing priorities, lack of direction and strategy. Scrum management - any agile team needs a scrum manager. This is especially important for situations where there's a lot of back and forth between various team members and the development team. The scrum master also acts as your default project manager, shepherding the project along the way and making sure everything is done on time and on budget. Design - Your app will be going up against remarkable beautiful and easy to use apps on the app market. That's why you need A-level designers to take care of the feel and look of the app. Business analysis - Creating an actionable mobile app strategy requires great business analysis skills. This person will put the app vision into perspective and help map your objectives into development roadmap for the development team. This team member will also spend a lot of his or her time on market research, competitive analysis, feature set documentation and much more. QA testing - Testing your app several times during the development and final phase will help deliver a truly market-ready product. That's why you need experts who are conversant with industry standards of QA testing. Technical app development skills - these are the most important ones to take into consideration. After all, it is a team of developers/coders who will actually hammer out the app. Good developers are well versed in modern coding languages, cloud infrastructure, cross-platform skills, data integration, cloud integration, security integration, and much more. Decide if the app is to be built in-house or by working with an external vendor. Whichever road you choose, be sure to do due diligence before putting together your team or contracting an external vendor.  A strategically built product lasts forever. And a mobile app will only be successful if it has a well-planned product roadmap. This is a plan which maps out both the short term and long term goals of your app. More specifically, your product roadmap will help define your app vision, as well as act as a blueprint for the execution of your mobile app development strategy. In most cases, the roadmap will help clarify the overall app development strategy to vendors, investors, clients, and other key stakeholders. Once you have your goals set, you can easily create a product roadmap. Ensure that your goals are clearly defined and easily measurable, which means that you need to have some metrics and KPIs in place.  What is the minimum viable product (MVP)? Is it good enough to pique users’ interest? That’s exactly what a good product would help you achieve. A minimum viable product refers to a set of features and functionalities that are enough to make your app successful at launch. An MVP is manageable, realistic and only covers features you simply cannot go to production without. In other words, the MVP should be structured in such a way that it helps you build only the app features most closely aligned with your primary objectives and goals. In addition, your definition of MVP should be data-centric. An app-driven MVP roadmap delivers better outcomes. Implementing the right data analytics will help you establish your team’s success right from the outset. For your MVP, it would be wise to focus on a small set of essential metrics. Your final product, however, should encompass metrics like UX, featured usage, customer churn, user retention, UX, adoption rates, and product quality, just to mention a few. The MVP should be structured in such a way that it helps you build only the app features most closely aligned with your primary objectives and goals.

The eight steps above are the single most difficult and nerve-wrenching part of building an app. And by default, the most important. Everything else we talk about below is a breeze to execute if the previous eight steps were done correctly. Let’s carry on with the ‘fun part’ of building an app  The usability and design of the app will either make users come back to your app or make them uninstall the app right after the first use. There are many things to keep in mind when designing an app that’ll resonate well with the end user. Great apps are not complex to use. In fact, far from it. They are easy and simple to use. But simple design is the toughest form of design. Nonetheless, that should be your goal first and foremost. Try to imagine why you want to design the app and why you are looking to achieve. What exactly do you want your app to look like and do? How will you ensure that your app will pique the user's interest? What's the solution do you want to offer with your app? How will your app stand out in terms of design? Determine the style of your app. Work with your creative team on the design guidelines that fully align with goal of your app. Go for a style that will help your app set itself apart from the rest. In addition, keep cognitive loads to a minimum. Remember that the user’s brain has a limited processing power and you shouldn’t subject them to cognitive or information overload (by which you mean your users will become easily frustrated if they can’t figure out, at a glance, how to use your app). This is an area of design that you need to get a handle on to prevent users from being overwhelmed. If they do, they will most likely abandon your app. Create and test multiple design ideas until there is one that is the right concept. Then build on it. The design process should be all about feedback, refining, and repeat. If you leave your users hanging, you will likely design an app that will be a pain to use.  Your app designs is looking great and you’re rocking that invision prototype. Now what? Of course, the next step is to build the actual app. Start with a prototype to ensure that the app is indeed what was planned. Build the flow that will be most used and test it. Ensure that it is an embodiment of the concept. Once the prototype is successfully tested, move ahead with the full development process. Be ready to make adjustments quickly as the app starts taking shape. The later in the development stage, the more complex it becomes to make changes. So, design an app architecture that is flexible, while still being scalable (this goes back to the point above regarding choosing the right technology stack). Of course, there are a few key mistakes that you need to avoid at all costs to ensure that your app building process is hitch-free: In today's digital world plagued with data security breaches, you need to build your app with security at the heart of everything. It is a fact of life that hackers and other ill-reputed cyber-criminals will go above and beyond to crack your app. Does your app have the necessary security framework to be impenetrable? Have TLS, SSL and AES encryption technology in place to keep your mobile app hacker-proof. The chances are that you are building your app with specific users in mind. That's all good, but the actual architecture of your app should be crafted with global audiences in mind. Remember that your app should be built in a way that it easy to scale in order to accommodate growth and expansion.  Test, test, and test should be your mobile app development mantra. And let’s be candid - after putting in countless hours of effort and hard work into building a great app, the last thing you want to see is a barrage of negative user reviews and ratings. You need to come up with a proper app testing strategy and follow it to the dot. What makes a solid app testing strategy? Your QA testing strategy should align with a number of your goals, including customer expectations, business goals, the user experience, as well as industry best practices. It should take care of all aspects of the app, including data requirements battery usage, app speed, memory usage and so forth. Be religious about testing the app at every opportunity. Bugs are one of the top reasons why customers choose to delete apps, or not use them any longer. In addition, consider all target user personas. Drill your app tests down to the last user. There are several different app user personas, and you need to test for all of them. You will also have to think about technical users, those who speak different languages, different age groups, those with accessibility issues, and so forth. Keep your tests fresh and data-driven. More importantly, keep updating the text plan to include new test cases and modify older ones as the app keeps evolving. Furthermore, as a rule of thumb, a great app test should take into account every possible way the user will use the app. It should also consider unusual use cases. What happens when they swipe with two fingers instead of one, or vice versa? What if a user exits the app by mistake? It is crucial to map your entire mobile app to test every use case/scenario. In addition, conduct tests on every relevant device. Once the app is launched, start with alpha and beta testing to ensure the expert users are good with the end product, before launching to the masses. By the way, there are at least two approaches to after-launch app testing: manual or automated. Automated app testing is ideal when your app is still in development. However, it can be costly. If that’s an issue for you, manual testing might appeal to your lean budget. Usability testing - The fundamental functionalities of your app are tested at this point. Usability tests include UI testing, compatibility testing, external factors testing, and ADA compliance testing. Performance testing is another crucial component of the QA process that you need to conduct to establish how your app stacks in terms of power management, memory use, and scalability. Finally, don't forget to perform compliance and security testing. If you are building a telehealth app, for instance; you need to be compliant with a series of industry regulations like HIPAA, HITRUST, ISO, etc. You should also test the security readiness of your app. Once all the tests are over, you should have a comprehensive and highly detailed report that entails: At this point, you should have plenty of insights and information to leverage to improve your app before launch or for the next iteration.  The final step of the mobile app development process is finally here. You are finally ready to deploy it. This step will ensure that your launch will be a breeze and hassle-free. Your launch date is not just for building buzz and getting your app on the store. It should provide you with an opportunity to carry out user a plethora of interviews, collect feedback, and get ready for the next step: iteration. You’ll need a good post-launch strategy and plan. Yes, life after launching your app should be bliss, but that isn’t always the case. Here’s a checklist for creating an awesome post-launch plan: The user is king. So, listen carefully to what users are saying, especially about the first impression and use of your app. At this stage, you should ramp up your user ratings and reviews - they are the most valuable and reliable sources of user feedback to help inform your next step. Churn rate, user satisfaction rate, sales, revenue, the average duration of a user session, daily active users, monthly active users, and the number of installs are some of the data metrics that you need to analyze to get a better understanding of your app usage and acceptance. Great analytics tools will allow for the complete monitoring of your app and give a clear picture of how well the app is doing with the target audiences. More crucially, look at and understand the numbers and then take the right steps to optimize the app. Let everyone know that you have launched a fantastic app. Use all marketing channels and resources your marketing dollars can afford. Strategies like content, SEO, and ASO will cost you virtually nothing yet they deliver great results. If you got to this point, read out comprehensive article on The 2021 Mobile App Marketing Guide with 25 Pro Tips. Another pitfall of many apps is minimal or zero support. Invest in mobile app support. The better the experience users have after they download your app, the more likely they will be to recommend the app to others. And support plays a big role in that experience. You should provide users will great support 24/7. This way, you can get your app off the ground on the right foot with the users.  It is not an impossible task to translate a great idea into a great app. There’s a ton to be said about developing a great app. It’s a very precise job. There are several pitfalls between an initial concept and when an app becoming successful. But with a proper strategy, the right people, the correct processes, and a clear plan to grow, these pitfalls can be avoided. These pitfalls that can happen at any stage or level of mobile app development, including these top four: Strategy level: bad/lack of market research, improper planning of execution stages, and lack of clearly defined goals are a few reasons why your app is set to fail right from the strategy level. Design and software development level: Lack of a robust QA testing strategy, bad app design, back tech stack or improperly implemented technology, and poor execution could kill your app before it is built. Execution level: You mobile app can fail at the stage due to a number of reasons, including teams issues when there are conflicting priorities, too much competition/heat from similar apps on the app, cash shortages that make it hard to take your app to the next level, and if you have no clue on how to monetize your app. Support and marketing level - Having no crystal-clear marketing message, lack or no user ratings/reviews, unclear branding, and lack of differentiation from competitors can plague your app at the support and marketing level. So, why build an app when the above reasons can be so deterrent? As we have seen in this guide, there are plenty of reasons to build a mobile app. These include the following: An app can help you increase sales - with 19 percent of retail sales coming from mobile, an app can help you tap into this increasingly important consumer base. After all, mobile apps deliver 3x more conversions than mobile sites. Improve customer experiences (UX) - a well-defined app can help you meet your customers where they need you most: mobile. Building a user-friendly app will also improve your customers shopping and purchasing experiences. Become competitive on the market - 65 percent of SMEs and all big companies already have (or are in the process of building) an app. Build one to stay competitive. Deliver excellence through another amazing channel - an app is a marketing and sales tool that can do wonders for your customer acquisition, pleasing, loyalty and retainment. Better customer engagement - an app with a feedback mechanism, live chat feature or a help desk, as well as interactive features like push notification can do wonders for your customer engagement. Boost recognition and brand awareness - the more users open your app, the more recognizable your app will be. Ensure that your app is stylish and loaded with engaging content to promote your brand and boost credibility and trust. Building the actual app is no easy walk in the park. As we’ve mentioned above, you need to follow 12 key steps to make the whole process easy and successful. Step #1. Value proposition - Create a unique value proposition for the app. How is it different from other similar apps, the benefits it will bring to users, how it will make their lives better, etc. Step #2. Market Research and SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities & Threats) Analysis To Determine the viability of your product. Validate the concept first, then invest in market research before spending a large amount of time and money on building an app. Is the market ready? Who are the top competitors? What are the threats? Once the market data is in, start planning a course of action. Step #3. Outline your app goals. List the 3-4 most important goals of the app that will determine how users will interact with the app. Next, brainstorm the actions that users will perform within the app. Don’t forget to define the right key performance indicators to measure success, and look at the great apps in the market to learn how they do things well. Step #4. Brainstorm the primary use cases of your app and which users to target. In doing so, do not clutter the app with everything for everyone. Rather, launch with a specific set of use cases meant for a clearly-defined group of people. Step #5. Create a monetization model. A proper monetization model is critical to ensure the long term longevity of the app. Step #6. Determine the framework of the app. At this stage, you need to decide if the app is going to be on iOS, on Android, or both. Also, plan your technology stack to ensure maximum return on investment while keeping an eye on the future. Step #7. Build the perfect development team. The right team can make the make, the wrong team will break it. Choose product managers, designers, developers, amazing developers and gifted QA analysts. Step #8. Define the product roadmap of your app. Don’t forget to define a detailed set of requirements for your app. What is the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)? Is it good enough to pique users’ interest? Step #9. Design the app. Set proper design goals and keep it easy to use. Apps with great UX design are most likely to get used often. Step #10. Build the app. Start with a prototype, then build the user flow that will be most used and test it. Once the prototype is successfully tested, move ahead with the full development process. Be ready to make adjustments quickly as the app starts taking shape, Step #11. Test, test, test. Build a proper app testing strategy and follow it to the dot. More crucially, keep updating the text plan to include new test cases and modify older ones as the app keeps evolving. Finally … Step #12. Launch the app. Start off by creating a scalable and robust deployment process. Not just that, learn from user feedback and data analytics to optimize your app for usability, performance, etc. In a nutshell, know your users and cater to their needs. That should be the driving philosophy every app maker adopts. An app should be built around a user, not the other way round.

I downloaded this app & began a totally new adventure. As time provides, I’ve been slowly delving into what I thought would be an amazing experience where banking and bill pay would become easily completed with minimal effort. Wrong, not entirely true. At this point I am frustrated. To simply pay my bills every month, without fumbles, less stress and time, I find out from ALL options, I’m not able to do online banking to pay aforementioned bills because I don’t have the necessary accounts available to do so. I have checking, savings and a fairly healthy CD.....I wonder, why can’t I bank online? Why does it say I’m unable to use this app for online banking because I haven’t the accounts to do so? Huh? What? I’m so confused! I can’t locate the forms I need either....I want to be sure when I pass, my daughter receives all my monies from these “Appropriately Established” accounts! I’ve called 3 times to have the forms mailed to me...to no avail and I’m unable to pay my bills online. I’m disabled, hooked up to oxygen, unable to go into the bank as I mentioned when I called. I was told to open online banking that that would help me handle everything from home. If I figure it out one day, you’ll receive the 5th star. Take care my friend. The new Bill Pay section is poorly designed trash that has ruined the app experience. Not only is it ugly, it does a poor job of visually integrating with the rest of the app. Clunky and unintuitive, to now make an online payment you must sift through multiple screens, making multiple clicks—all of which is very confusing to the consumer. You now also have to manually assign a “pay by” date to complete the process which is terribly annoying. (The default should be set similar to the pre-updated version that automatically sets the earliest possible date for you. But, still allow a user to manually set their own “pay by” date if needed.) Overall, the former Bill Pay was MUCH easier to utilize and MUCH nicer to look at. To add to the problems, we no longer have the ability to delete old “Pay To” accounts from within the app the way we could previously. Another oversight. BOA has definitely taken steps backwards with this update. If I had to guess, budget cuts forced BOA to begin implementing new app updates via internal junior-level design team, rather than outsourcing to a professional UI/UX firm. As a result, this update has a “beta” feel displaying poor form, function and usability. Really embarrassing for a big bank. The developer, Bank of America, indicated that the app’s privacy practices may include handling of data as described below. For more information, see the developer’s privacy policy. The following data may be collected and linked to your identity: The following data may be collected but it is not linked to your identity: Privacy practices may vary, for example, based on the features you use or your age.

Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like \"1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA\") into geographic coordinates (like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map.

Retrieve Facebook data and automate actions (ex. posting). Create a simple app that makes requests to the Gmail API in just 5 to 10 minutes. REST Countries v1 Get information about countries via a RESTful API Putting mobile apps together is hard work. But there’s no need to reinvent the wheel. Many existing apps have great well-designed features already. If third-party app developers require certain popular features in their projects, they can simply integrate them into their work using APIs. An API, or application programming interface, is a set of pre-prepared coding instructions that third-party apps can subsume into their designs. These coding instructions provide third-party apps with pre-prepared functions, relieving developers of the responsibility to code in those functions from scratch. A mobile app development API is just an API meant to assist programmers in setting up mobile apps and providing them with various features. All APIs function according to a fairly straightforward general template. Usually, they are based on what’s known as a REST architecture, meaning that they use HTTP requests to handle and update data. Specifically, this happens whenever users want to request, post, and delete some kind of data. The REST API then returns the data in JSON, which can then be used by a third-party mobile app to do further things. This general architecture allows even free APIs for app development to carry out a great many different functions. Mobile app development APIs are meant for mobile app developers who want to simplify their work without settling for a drop in the quality of their apps. The best APIs for mobile apps can do this seamlessly. They can provide maximal increases in in-app functionality for minimal work. Since mobile app development can be difficult, APIs are an incredibly helpful tool. They enable developers to put many of the best already-existing features into their apps and keep their customers happy. Easier app-building means more and better apps, which leads to happier users. When developers grab any free APIs for Android or iOS from RapidAPI, they can expect to vastly improve the capabilities of the mobile apps they design. Music apps can gain easy access to the streaming library Spotify; shipping apps can use geolocation data from Google Maps or REST Countries, and so on. Users can therefore also expect greatly enhanced experiences. Yes. Rapid API has plenty of free APIs for app development. Their functionalities and capabilities cover an extremely diverse range. Rest Countries v1 can provide geolocation data for shipping apps, RAWGS Video Game Database can give mobile apps access to a huge collection of games, and the FacebookGraph API is perfect to help companies manage their social media presence free of charge.

Solely depending on the business objective, those who want to reach a wide range of visitors opt for a mobile-friendly website (responsive). Nevertheless, if you primarily focus on delivering the best user experience which, in turn, brings more leads and promising business growth, a mobile app is the choice. Our business and technology consultants offer their expertise to work on feasibility. All you need is explain your idea or business objectives to our experts. Our experts will then delve deeper into it and come up with a proper strategy for your app idea and then suggest the advantageous platform and POC (proof of concept) for your mobile app. Once finalized, we then implement the plan and convert your thoughts or idea into a perfect mobile app. From the healthcare industry to retail, and finance to entertainment, Prismetric has served almost all the industries under the sun. Our business and technology consultants can help you design, develop, and maintain customized mobile apps and websites. Whether a single page app or a complex eCommerce portal, we can help you build the best solution to ease your business processes. Proof of Concept (POC), Mobile prototype, and Minimum Viable Product (MVP) are the ways to ensure that the product is going to be result-oriented. Our consultants focus on mobile app prototyping that validates strategic designing for the mobile app. Moreover, such a prototype would reflect the original app and help in studying the user experience.   The mobile app development cycle is not linear, as changes in the requirements are unavoidable. It is for this reason, the agile development method is practiced at Prismetric which enables the app developer adopt changes and render flexibility to the product. Our unique app development method allows the testers to review the progress and ensure that the project is in line with the business objectives. Long story short, agile development makes your mobile app better and scalable while it is getting built. There is no one figure that can be estimated to develop mobile application on Android or iOS platform. The costs, as in any other products development, depend on the complexity of the app. For instance, a single page mobile app would cost you way cheaper than a full-fledged multi-tier eCommerce portal. Our business and technology consultants are here to help you with the cost of the app. You can discuss the business objectives and requirements with our app development experts to have an idea about the budget. Moreover, do check our different hiring models. Prismetric is a client-centric mobile app development company and, therefore, we have designed our ‘hiring models’ in a way that they are affordable to all – from individuals to mid-sized companies to MNCs.

Our business and technology consultants will work to look into the app development project to come up with a fixed cost and timeline. Hourly based hiring: You are charged hourly. Here, the mobile app development project with no defined objective or the tasks that are ongoing or require frequent changes are covered. You’ll pay as you use the experts hourly. When the project is kick started, we give you a timeline for each milestone. You will be provided with all the updates for each milestone during the mobile app development project lifecycle. Also, you can, in between, ask for the progress as well. We will be happy to provide you with needed information. While most app development companies have gloomy plans for the maintenance of the applications they develop, Prismetric walks an extra mile to assure you that the project does not get finished once the app is launched. An app is like a plant that requires care and nourishment. Our after-sales/maintenance service contract tackles every hitch that may affect your business growth. We help you maintain the application for a specific period as mentioned in the contract so that it remains up and running. Prismetric has been serving businesses with its bespoke IT solutions since 2011. With over 200 clientele base internationally, we believe that business should be beyond any monetary gains.

Hi Ngan , You have done a great job in this blog by sharing the best fax app for mobile and tablets. Thanks for sharing !!!! I would also recommend Snapfax. It is new and works for both Android and iOS. It is super easy to use. Highly recommend. https://snapfaxapp.com/index.html I use iFax, which works just fine. But the whole process is tainted by the total uselessness of this ancient technology still being in the business sphere. It is like the Pony Express and there is just nothing better about faxing something than emailing an attachment. I have these crusty old backward clients who think faxing is something new and techie and require me to have a fax number and fool around with this wasteful process. There, now. I’m better. The PURPOSE of using fax is to send sensitive material, like escrow papers, bank paperwork, etc. If it ALSO sends to your email, then you have defeated the purpose of using fax, which was to avoid the risk of your sensitive document sent over the unsecured internet!! So I would only look for a fax that doesn’t require that any of your documentation be sent by email. You’re funny! lol I would also recommend Fax Plus. the best thing in this app is the quality of the fax. it offers that best Fax quality with very affordable rates. Thank you all for the additional recommendations. Appreciate it. Faxing is an axe used by companies to make tasks more difficult for you to their advantage, or they are just stuck in the past There are tons of negative comments for eFax, when looking into each of these in the Google Play store. Are you sure it’s a good program??? No discussion of customer service. I am living the customer service nightmare with hellofax right now so I am looking to switch to a company that actually has some. #hellofax guess I know why you are not on this list. I would add etherfax.my if you’re looking an fax service provider in Malaysia. However, those mentioned above are really good ones also. Cheers! I only need to send a three page fax every few months so I don’t want to subscribe to a fax service. FaxBurner looks like what I need. Anyone used it? Opinions? I liked it – except apparently it stops being free after sending 5 pages. Then $99 US per year! After all this searching I still am not decided where to turn. You can look into sendafax if you need an alternative worth checking out. Which is the best internet fax service? What is Internet Fax or eFax? How to fax from Windows computer? Is there such a thing as Google Fax? AVOID FaxBurner! I would suggest removing it from this list. They claimed a yearly price of 79.99 but charged 100.92 without any disclaimer. Email to their support could not be delivered and was returned to my spam folder. I immediately cancelled with a note about the inflated charge. Their response was that they had no access to details since it went through itunes. I will dispute charge with Citi Visa if it posts. Great article. Which app would you recomend to send faxes from Argentina to Canada? I have a windows phone can I use this fax service using my phone? If yes, how? Can you please describe a little bit more? I will wait for your further reply. Nothing in this list is FREE. All of them make you fill out fax numbers, attach documents, etc. and then you get to decide if you’re going to pay the fee that is only now available to see, or if you will simply delete the fax and not pay the ransom. Typically, you can’t use the internet to send faxes because faxes need analog signals of a phone line. For this reason, you will need a fax service and Google products. Remember, Google doesn’t offer a specific fax service. You can use third party fax services to complete your job. Your email address will not be published.

        "body": "Sign in   HashStudioz Technologies Feb 19, 2020·6 min read Researches and data reveal the fact that the hours spent on the internet are increasing each year. And so, the number of mobile applications. Not to mention that mobile apps are more convenient to use than desktop applications. Hence, the companies are shifting their attention from the traditional desktop applications to mobile applications to get the highest benefits from their target audiences. In recent past years, many startup ideas rose because of the successful and timely developed mobile apps. How can we forget the examples of the life-changing apps? From Milkbasket to Uber Eats to Dunzo all have solved a genuine problem of our everyday struggle. And we feel proud to be the baseline for the success of Milkbasket, MyPeriodTracker, WTfares, 3D car configurator, and many more startups. So, If you have a startup idea in your head, discuss it with us and we will help you to be listed in the success stories ahead. There is a myth that Mobile app development required lots of money to hire mobile app developers, which only large-scale businesses & corporations were able to afford, thanks to mobile app development frameworks, it’s not the case anymore. Today, there are many mobile app development frameworks available to choose from. And the best thing? — These app development frameworks allow building mobile apps in limited budget & time. As there are lots of options available, choosing the best framework for app development is not easy. There is so much to think about!! But to help you in making the decision, below we have listed the top 7 frameworks for mobile app development along with their features, pros & cons, and app examples. Let’s dive in each app development framework one by one. React Native is one of the most popular framework for mobile app development. Initially built by facebook, It is used for the development of both platforms Android and iOS. Many high performance mobile apps have been built in a short period through this framework. The app example can be seen in startups and fortune 500 companies. This framework reduces the time it takes to build a mobile app that is both powerful and reliable. React Native does this because it’s a cross-platform mobile app development framework that uses the same code base for both Android and iOS applications. Key Features The framework launched by Google is more of a software development kit than a mobile app development framework. Flutter is popular for building fast beautiful, natively compiled apps for both mobile & web applications. Flutter is also a cross platform app development framework that uses a single code base for both iOS and Android app development. It is based on an object-oriented programming language- Dart. Apart from being a cross platform framework, Flutter also allows developers to modify old widgets & create new widgets effortlessly. Key Features Ionic is again a widely used open source app development framework built with Angular and cordova. It also supports cross platform development and you can develop apps for three different platforms here — Android, iOS and Windows. Ionic uses minimal DOM to enhance performance and bring better efficiency while providing the native APIs like Ionic Native and Cordova. The best part of using Ionic Framework for mobile app development is its UI elements. It provides a set of default UI elements such as action sheets, tab bars, filters, forms, and navigation menu, which helps developers focus on the development part rather than on UI elements. Key Features Acquired by Microsoft, Xamarin is also an open-source, cross-platform mobile app development framework, which also uses the same code base for iOS and Android applications. Xamarin provides an excellent user interface and comes with almost all important tools that are required for a mobile app. The important thing about Xamarin is that it uses C# programming language, which means there is no need to learn Swift or Java to build an iPhone or Android app. Key Features: PhoneGap was initially built by Nitobi in 2011 and launched as Apache Cordova Adobe. However, after the acquisition by Adobe its name changed to Adobe PhoneGap. It is a cross-platform mobile app development framework and is considered as a reliable platform for developers to develop apps in JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. It provides best-in-class performance, and enables mobile app developers to build apps without facing any hardware restrictions also supports inbuilt hardware features such as Camera, GPS, Storage, Accelerometer, etc. Key Features: Launched in 2009, Corona is an open-source cross-platform framework ideal for rapidly creating apps and games for mobile devices, desktop, tablets & smart TV. It is a Lua based framework, which is a popular light-weight scripting language that offers speed, ease of usage and flexibility to develop apps. Developers are using this free, open-source, and powerful framework to build apps to most of the platforms including Android, iOS, macOS, Tablets, Fire TV, Android TV, Apple TV, and Amazon Fire. Many popular games like Angry Birds and Warcraft have utilized the robust Corona framework. Key Features: Mobile Angular is also a free open-source mobile UI framework that helps in building mobile apps with a combination of bootstrap and Angular framework. Under MIT License, this framework simplifies the mobile app development process. It provides numerous UI components like switches, scrollable areas, overlays, navbars to build a seamless intuitive and attractive user interface for mobile apps. Key Features: So, with this we got to know about the top 7 mobile app development frameworks. And as far as the choice of the mobile development framework is concerned, the final decision largely depends on the requirements of your project. Like if you are developing a gaming app, then corona will be the best choice and so. Hence, it’s recommended to consult with an app development company to make sure you’re choosing the right framework. Do follow us if you found this blog useful.

Ivan Dubravac 05/06/2019. ... App owners monetize from Google AdMob or other advertisers.",
        "body": "What if I tell you that you can earn crypto while playing games on your mobile phone? If you played Blockchain mobile games before, as I did, you’ve probably already realized that most of them are fake. Usually, you need to watch a ton of ads to earn some crypto and to claim. However, earning a quick buck without spending a penny is like a dream come true. With a list of the following cryptocurrency game apps available on Google Play Store, you can mint money while enjoying playing. All you need is an android phone and access to the Internet. Are you excited? Don’t Be! Read more! If you download any Blockchain game, you’ll soon realize that you are watching a ton of ads. App owners monetize from Google AdMob or other advertisers. Some apps Like Storm Play offer quizzes and additional tasks to earn crypto. Every single game listed in this article is free to play. I was also careful to list games that are actually fun to play and require some element of skill as opposed to straight-up luck. To start playing and earning some of the following games require a Coinbase account. If you don’t have one please read first our post “How to Create Coinbase Bitcoin Wallet?” In the wallet section just enter your Coinbase email address and you are ready to play.  Storm Play is a gamified microtask platform. You can use it to earn Bitcoin, Ether or Storm. Storm coin is in top 200 coins with a market cap of almost $20 million. The tasks themselves are highly varied.

After downloading the Storm Play App and creating your account you can use our referral code to claim 6000 Bolts. You’ll need 200000 thousand Bolts to be able to withdraw. When you are ready to withdraw choose the form of cryptocurrency you prefer; Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) or Storm Token (STORM). Storm Play is only available on Android at the moment, but the developers have promised an iOS version is in the works. Invitation code: P4TJB3W6 Download  With this game, you can earn Ethereum and Popcoin. You need to group Bitcoin, Ether, Monero, Ripple and Neo coins together to pop them.

With this game, you can earn free Litecoin by spinning a wheel of Fortune. Invitation code: ppdqsj Earning free crypto without having to invest any money of your own is quite tempting. But remember there is nothing free in today’s world. Every luring technique has a deceptive motive behind it. Displaying ads in the middle of the game generates revenue for the app developers and with some apps, you could end up mining cryptocurrency without even knowing. I’ve tested hundreds of apps and only included ones in the list that are safe and working. But even so, I would not recommend playing them to anyone, because it is really time-consuming and it is a small profit. But if you are a student and want different crypto for free – it is a good start. Happy mining by BizzNerd Team!

        "body": "Milutina Milankovica 11b 11000 Beograd 12 min read 23 August 2019 Have an amazing idea for an app but no clue how to go about creating it? We review 10 best mobile app builders for people who want to make their own app and have little to no coding experience. We looked at leading app making platforms that have a proven track record in developing modern, functional and visually pleasing mobile apps. This is one of the most popular app makers on the market because it gives complete newcomers a chance to build their very own mobile app in minutes. Also, Appy Pie comes strapped with a host of unique features that allow users to add: Small and medium-sized businesses find this app builder useful because it offers a wide variety of plans to get users started for free. Once users get a feel for creating apps, then there are great subscription plans that can meet all budget sizes. Appy Pie places strong emphasis on customer service. The app maker includes an exhaustive list of tutorials, which addresses every possible issue that a user may encounter when building their app. Also, there’s a live chat option available to resolve any problems you may encounter when building your app. This is an ideal app maker for startups, entrepreneurs and small businesses. All the templates seem to look the same. While there are options available to help you tinker with layout options and background images, this is not enough; more options should be available. While you won’t be building the next Airbnb app with this product, it nevertheless offers you the ability to create a basic app that will offer all the necessary functionalities. This leading platform is one of the most reliable app builders on the market. Well over 30,000 businesses have used BuildFire to develop their apps. This platform is popular with brands, influencers and small to mid-sized businesses. Within a couple of days, you can publish an app and give your customers access to your product/service resources via the app. BuildFire is so popular because of its user-friendly interface, easy and fast reconfigurability and virtually limitless customization options. Its intuitive and sleek UI makes building iOS or Android applications a breeze. You can make quick changes and test them in real time. BuildFire’s billing system doesn’t function clearly; it’s not easy to find previous invoices. The editor should be a little simpler; it may take some time for people to get used to it. Therefore, it would’ve been great to have included additional tutorials on the editor for newcomers to app builders like BuildFire. Even though the editor takes some time getting used to, you’ll build an industry standard app in no time even if you have no coding background. This app building platform with a curious name is based out of the French island of Corsica and boasts some of the most stunning themes. GoodBarber offers an intuitive and flexible experience when building apps. And the experience is seamless even if you’ve never coded before. Once you sign up, you can start working on your app immediately. Since the platform is a web utility, you can develop your app across all devices. However, what really makes this platform stand out from the crowd is the huge list of features it offers including: The layout of the platform is well designed, so that you’ll be able to see where all the options and add-ons are located. You can choose whether you want the plan to develop native Android apps for $32 per month or a plan for both Android and iOS apps, which would set you back $96. Both options include an impressively advanced web app. The app doesn’t provide e-commerce support. It would have been great if the platform had its own online store. However, there is always the option to integrate content from most 3rd-party stores like Amazon or Shopify, and sharing platforms like Youtube, Vimeo or DailyMotion. In October 2019, GoodBarber has introduced a “Shopping App” product offering for eCommerce. Developed for iOS, Android, and mobile web via Progressive Web Apps, GoodBarber Shopping Apps deliver a shopping experience that rivals the most innovative brands among the App builders industry. Awesome designs and built-in eCommerce features complete the eCommerce offering to boost sales conversions This platform offers one of the easiest ways to make an app. We absolutely love that developing an app with GoodBarber is so simple and fun, that every computer user with very basic skills can publish mobile apps. This easy to use platform places a lot of emphasis on design; your app will look stunning and polished with Shoutem’s sleek templates. Therefore, if visually appealing apps are very important to you, then Shoutem should be your choice. We absolutely love Shoutem’s editor, which is a joy to use. The crystal clear instructions and a beautiful layout give you a preview of how your app will function. The platform also offers many options to customize so that each app you develop has its own special design and feel. The builder gives users an incredible amount of options to customize themes, layouts, colors and typography. So, your apps will look good and be packed with great features. Shoutem is perfect for Event apps because of its Social Wall, where users can post pictures and share comments. It also offers great options for retail businesses. In fact, Shoutem’s monetization features such as mobile advertising support give you the option to earn back the money you invested to develop the app. One of the platform’s most attractive features is its integration with Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare and WordPress. The subscription plan is somewhat pricey. Their least expensive plan that allows you to publish apps on the App store starts at $79. This price might be an issue for small to mid-sized businesses and startups. This is in part to cover the cost of manual reviews due to Apple’s 4.2.6. guidelines. Also, it’s pretty strange that the website and the app editor interface are only available in English. One of the features we wish Shoutem offered in its latest version is ad support. While the latest release is impressive, it actually comes with less features than previous versions. Shoutem is also on the pricey side. However, the actual process of developing the app makes up for the lack of some features. It’s great for making small business apps because of its full integration with WordPress blog and Shopify store. AppMachine is yet another easy and fun to use app maker. A first time app developer will find the process smooth and seamless. This playful platform from the Netherlands comes with a lego-style editor. Well over 200,000 apps have been made with AppMachine. Right now, there are 2 different price plans: Plus at $49 a month and Pro at $69 a month. What sets this app builder apart from other options on the market is its automation of many tedious processes. For e.g., if you wish to copy all the relevant data from your web page to the app builder, then you can do that by simply adding your URL. You can also transfer information and images from your social media accounts. The editor with its simple design is both visually pleasing and easy to use. The platform also comes with many beautiful and modern flexible templates to choose from. Also, there are literally hundreds of fonts to make your mobile app unique. AppMachine is packed with all the necessary app features: Some of the features offered in the Pro price plans are not yet ready to use. It would have been better had they left them out of the platform until they made them fully functional. Also, we wish they spent more time improving the performance of the user interface. AppMachine is a great mobile app builder that is easy to use and makes amazing apps. While there are a few features that still need to be introduced, overall this is a phenomenal mobile app builder which will help you develop interactive and modern apps. This platform uses one of the simplest drag and drop editors, has over a thousand different sleek templates and comes with a built in Content Management System. iBuildApp offers a large selection of tools and marketing features that will make your app look sleek and professional. The intuitive interface is designed to allow an inexperienced user to develop a fully functional app in 5 minutes. Your customers will enjoy the app’s beautiful layout, simplicity and fast load time. iBuildApp is a versatile mobile app builder that you can use to develop great and stunning apps with zero programming skills. The builder comes with a free trial, which will let you get a feel for the platform before you make any serious investments. During the rare times when the app becomes unresponsive, the user has to get in touch with customer service via Zendesk, which can take some time to resolve. You can start publishing feature-rich mobile apps in no time. This popular mobile app builder has been used more than a million times, and is the perfect tool to establish your mobile presence and engage customers and prospects. This is a perfect option for small businesses looking to enter the mobile app market. We love that with an intuitive interface and a wide array of support options, this platform can be used both by novices and skilled programmers. This is app building platform really grabbed our attention! AppMakr is one of the largest do-it-yourself mobile app builders that offers great solutions to small businesses, non-profits and individuals. Almost 2 million apps have been developed using AppMakr. The platform offers both free and paid plans. Users can make decent basic apps with the free version. We love the fact that a user without any experience in programming can build a fully functioning app in under 20 minutes. The process of building the app involves adding text, audio, video and HTML elements. Once you’re done, it AppMakr makes it very simple to publish the app on online stores. The platform also allows the user to perform quality assurance with a set of powerful tools. Also, you can add updates to the app once it’s been published. And it does this at a very attractive price-the yearly plan will set you back $99 for both iOs and Android apps. This is probably one of the most affordable app builders on the market. One of AppMakr’s most attractive features is the simulator that presents results in real-time as you build your app. The editor leaves much to be desired. While it offers some nice features, it absolutely needs to be redesigned. It doesn’t respond quickly, and is overly-sensitive. It can get pretty annoying when you move an icon, the editor loads which oftentimes can make you misplace the icon in the editor. A couple of times, the editor froze for a few minutes. The editor must be overhauled! Once AppMakr improves the editor’s performance, this could easily be the best platform for individuals and small-business to get started with publishing industry-standard apps. This is a cloud-based app maker that gives users the ability to publish apps for iOS, Android and even Windows Phone. Since this platform is in the cloud, there’s no need to download or install anything. So, you start developing apps quickly. You can easily share your project with clients, business users or developers in real time. Appery uses a drag and drop feature to design the UI, and also allows you to implement REST API to your app. This platform fits well with users of varying skill sets. Eager novices are given instructive tutorials and useful guidelines that will give them the necessary skills to make basic mobile apps, whereas experienced users can build the app using the source code. Users are given a wide selection of plans-from free plans to those that you’ll set you back $180 a month. Appery’s non-refundable policy means that you should take full advantage of the free trial before you sign up for a more comprehensive plan. If you’re a complete newcomer to the world of app building, then you’ll need to set aside some time to get used to the platform. Also, if you want to do something a little more elaborate in your app, then you must have at least some programming knowledge. While this platform is built for both novices and seasoned professionals alike, it is also clear that beginners have to be willing to learn the basics. They can use Appery to build their mobile app with no programming knowledge. However, if users want to take full advantage of the platform, then they’ll need to brush up on their programming skills. Choosing Appery makes sense for a small team that wants to collaborate on one big shared project. The price tag makes it too pricey for developing simple mobile apps. Here’s an app builder designed for developing games 2D games for Android, iOS, and even HTML5 and OS X. Much like other popular app building platforms, GameSalad comes with a drag and drop interface that allows users to build games without any programming background. The drag and drop interface makes it very easy to create different levels by setting the stage in your desired order, similar to Mario Level Creator for Nintendo gaming systems. GameSalad has a scene and actor editor which allows you to include actors in a scene you design using images, sounds and creating attributes. The platform has an active community forum where users can get assistance and advice from more experienced game designers. The plans start from free and go all the way up to $299 a year. GameSalad definitely needs to add more features. Also, there isn’t enough support between older Mac devices and new ones. More features should be added to customize the interface of the game. Also, it takes time to publish your data on the internet. You can only publish a project directly to the Android platform if you have a pro version. GameSalad comes with impressive functionality and is a great tool for building 2D games. The pricing of this product is reasonable and affordable. This is a great option for beginner game makers to build simple, fun 2D games. It’s great for learning about game design basics. This platform is one of the giants in the mobile app building market. Its users include Universal, Disney and TED.org. Therefore, as you can imagine, the pricing plans reflect the stature of their client list. The cheapest plan starts at $149 a month, while their PRO plan will set you back $799 a month! Mobile Roadie is a great builder for artists and bands because it comes with fun community app features like chat and fan wall. Also, the music player can be integrated seamlessly into your app. The platform also offers other advanced and interesting features such as Geo-targeting the content, which gives users content specific to their location. The templates come with many design options,and you can tinker with them to match your style. The wide range of features on offer makes building apps on this platform time-consuming. Also, Mobile Roadie doesn’t allow you to preview the changes as you’re developing the app. It’s definitely not a huge deal, but it would have been nice to have this feature. Mobile Road also needs to work on making the user interface more intuitive. This is one of the best mobile app builders available; not many app builders can claim to offer Geo-fencing, mapping tools and Geo-targeting features. However, all this does come at a price. If money is not an issue, then you can use this platform for your next project. Do your detailed research before you start developing a mobile app with a builder. Different platforms will suit different needs; some platforms are great for small businesses, others are better suited for novices developing apps for fun. However, we would be remiss if we failed to point out the obvious faults of mobile app building platforms. By relying on builders to create your mobile apps, you are essentially using machines for your projects. And while you can use machines for mobile app development, it’s often better to use a group of professionals. Think about it this way. You can use Google Translate to translate foreign texts, but would you really rely on it to translate an important legal document? You probably wouldn’t, and you shouldn’t use machines for mobile app development either. Apps developed by programmers and those developed by an app builder are two widely different things. While app builders give users the ability to construct an app in a short amount of time and at an affordable price, there are serious drawbacks to using mobile app building platforms: However, there are times when using a mobile app builder can actually make sense. For instance, if you own a hair salon and need a simple booking app, then using a building platform can be warranted. However, builders are a fine solution for prototypes. Prototypes are only useful if you want to have an idea how your mobile app will end up looking. You can tinker with them and decide what to add or delete. Therefore, be wary when mobile app builders claim that apps developed using their services are of the same quality as professionally developed apps. In the best case scenario, an app developed with a building platform will have an uninspiring user interface, a group of loosely connected features and little to no technical support. We’re here to help!

        "body": "In this article, we are discussing a few best healthcare apps that you can use without a second thought for doctor consultation  Diabetes is a common ailment. Everyone knows someone or the other who is suffering from this disease and the excruciating struggles one encounters if they run out of glucose tabs or test strips. Generis: DNA & Nutrition, a crowdsourced safety net for people struggling with Diabetes is one healthcare mobile app for patients that need to be downloaded or recommended.  Generis: DNA & Nutrition connects its users to nearby app users who might be able to offer required supplies or even help with a blood test or an injection. Healthcare also offers community advice and support in its forums.   While most healthcare mobile apps on this list bring you the best of physicians at your doorstep, it's hard to find specialists catering to the exact ailment you’re suffering from. Teladoc – 24/7 access to a doctor solves this issue by connecting its users with the right certified doctor or surgeon including a neurologist or a radiologist. The fee charged by these varies as they set their rates. It usually takes 24 hours or less to set up an appointment and then takes place on the online platform via video call. Teladoc – 24/7 access to a doctor also serves as an alternative for users to seek a second opinion. If your health plan does not provide all the telehealth benefits you need, and you’re sick of draining your health savings account, Teladoc – 24/7 access to a doctor is your go-to healthcare app for patients.   The Med&Beyond telehealth app is one of the top healthcare apps that provide top-notch health care services at your doorstep. If you think, What does an app do in the medical field? This app is a perfect solution to your question. This medical app offers a wide range of telemedicine services covering 24x7 online doctor checkups and consultations, without stepping out.  The app uses AI and machine learning tools that help you give quality health care experiences online.

While the healthcare marketplace offers a plethora of healthcare benefits, Epocrates is the go-to healthcare app for patients struggling with chronic disorders who need to consult a physician regularly. The credibility of this healthcare mobile app is in the user’s feedback and high rating on the Google Play Store and App Store. It is a comprehensive application created while keeping in mind all the problems a patient faces while undergoing medical treatment.   If there’s anyone who can understand the mysterious handwriting of a doctor, it's the pharmacist. Nearly everyone gets a doctor’s medical prescription into medicines via pharmacists. What if this medical genie went digital? We are talking about an app that lets patients easily communicate with their pharmacists regarding different medication articles, make refills, and process prescriptions all through the mobile application. PEPID serves all of these functions in one mobile app. They aim to make medical information more accessible by helping pharmacists go digital. While the app does entail cloud storage and digital solutions for pharmacies, PEPID also builds mobile apps for pharmacies. These custom applications can help pharmacists communicate with their customers while making the prescription fill process more convenient for everyone.   If your wife or a loved one is pregnant, this might be the best gift you can give them.

The mobile app has an elegant user interface based on a simple navigation wheel. Other features include informational videos, expert advice forums, personal photo albums, baby gear shopping, and a weekly pregnancy tracker. Although free, TotallyPregnant is riddled with links to online stores and in-app purchases of classes like Lamaze and yoga for pregnancy.   The genesis of this healthcare mobile app came about when its creators came across a staggering statistic that only 50% of the 71 million patients at risk for preventable vision loss get their eyesight examined by an eye specialist. To shift these numbers, the creators of OptoVie‪w‬, Insight Optics created a mobile app that offers the specialized care eyesight patients need from an ophthalmologist. What this mobile telemedicine mobile app does is that it records and refers retinal exams to local specialists for review. Any smartphone camera is attached to a handheld ophthalmoscope, allowing the app to record high-resolution images of the patient’s retina from their smartphone. The healthcare mobile app then presents the user with a list of ophthalmologists or optometrists readily available within a certain geographical area, allowing patients to get valuable insights into their eye health. The healthcare mobile app also empowers users with information on whether or not they need to see an eye specialist.   AirStrip is a free healthcare app for monitoring health vitals in maternity patients. All users have to do is enjoy the free pregnancy health-related advice, reminders, and help via free SMS messages. AirStrip offers data in the wavelength format and also highlights stats like fetal heartbeat and maternal contraction patterns. AirStrip monitors the patient 24*7 and presents the waveforms on one command.   After witnessing the impact of mobile apps like Airbnb, Uber, and Amazon in people’s lives. Phillips, the founder, and CEO of Medici decided to do the same in healthcare. His company took it upon itself to make healthcare more accessible for everyone and created two mobile applications, one for patients and one for providers. Medici allows users to with doctors in the Medici network for a fraction of the time and cost of going into a hospital. Once patients or mobile app users connect with their doctor, they can explain their illness, its symptoms and send pictures. The doctor will order a prescription directly to the patient’s pharmacy or confirm if the patient needs to visit him/her for an exam. Medici helps its users cut out unnecessary and expensive trips to the doctor’s office and make doctors accessible in a HIPPA-compliant online space.

It offers doctors that can treat non-emergency medical issues such as cold and flu symptoms, urinary tract infections, upper respiratory infections, allergies, sports injuries, back pain, heartburn, as well as many pediatric issues. The app allows you to access doctors that write you a prescription, even travel-related, and answer all your medical questions. The services offered also include a psychologist and a lactation consultation. Video Visits with doctors for medical issues cost a flat rate of $40 per session.

All of the user’s information remained anonymous and did I mention it's free?  While 75% of U.S adults own a smartphone, and 89% of total mobile media time spent is in apps, one would expect users to avail the best of mobile healthcare today’s digital age has to offer. Yet, they don’t because they are missing out on these 10 Amazing Healthcare mobile apps that bring effective healthcare to a single tap of a mobile app. These healthcare mobile devices and apps have provided many benefits that can not only help in keeping the health status quo in check but also enable users to take control of their healthcare services.

        "body": "JUST IN: The all-new Screen Recorder for Android. Learn more.  Introducing all new Android Screen Recorder  It can be pretty daunting to pick the best cell phone monitoring app when you have lots of options. Plus, who has got the time to review all the options and then pick only one. The trouble is that if you subscribe to a bad one, you won’t get a refund. Yep, you will be pretty much stuck with it. That’s why it’s really crucial to evaluate your options pretty closely and then pay for one. But don’t worry, we have made the job easier for you. We bring you the 12 best rated phone spy apps for 2021 that are available out there. With this guide, you will be able to compare the options you have and choose the app that best suits your needs. Let’s begin, shall we? Before you decide which mobile spying app is worth your money, here are some essential or in other words basic features that must be available in your app: Is it compatible with the OS of your phone? It can be either Android or iPhone. You also have to see if the app supports your phone. GPS tracking system lets you track the location of the target phone. A mobile spying app should have this as a crucial feature since you will be interested to know the whereabouts of your children or even employees. These are the most basic features to look for in cell phone spying apps as it is these conversations that can let you get to the bottom of some issue. Plus, some advance apps let you intercept calls and surroundings of the phones too. If you can get these features at a good price, then it is totally worth it. Since it is a spying software, it must be capable of working in discrete mode. You must be able to install it on the target device and be sure it will monitor things for you without being visible on the phone. A cheap app will give you cheap features and a pricey app will give you quality features. But that does not mean you should buy a spying app that is costly. If the app is actually offering great features and it is justifying the price, you can readily go for it. Since there is a huge variety of mobile spy apps these days, you will, of course, have a lot of companies to choose from. Before you purchase any of the best hidden spy apps, it is recommended to do your homework to be sure you have made the right choice. Here are some tips that will help you pick the right company: The product itself may be good but if the customer support is not good, then you may never be able to make the most of the product itself. If the website offers live chat support, test it. Ask a few questions related to the phone spy app and see if they are handled efficiently. Similarly, if a phone number is provided at the website, make sure it’s functional. The website doesn’t just give you a bigger picture of the product but the company itself. A decent company will always have a comprehensive website. Along with having details about the product, its features, tutorials, FAQs, guides, etc. also have information about the company, its location, and availability of support. Make sure the website has Terms and Condition, Privacy Policy and Disclaimer sections. Reading these pages will clear your head and help you decide whether to make a purchase or not. If a digital product bought online doesn’t come with a sound refund policy, then the risk of you losing your money gets pretty high. Because you never really know how the product would turn out to be unless you have already used it. The challenge with the online cell phone spying apps is that not many companies offer a free trial. Why? Because that free trial is most of the times enough for many people. Keeping that contingency into consideration, many top spy apps rather offer a fully-functional online demo in place for the free trial. Xnspy also has an impressive live demo which you could give a try before making a final purchase decision. A lot of people don’t take this into account but you should always consider the location of the company you are buying the mobile spy app from. Choose the company that’s located in your own country so that you don’t have to face time zone constraints. The location of the company also tells about its reliability and quality of services. We hope that this guide came as an answer to most of your questions related to the 12 best mobile spy apps. The purpose of creating this review was to make your decision easier and choose the right mobile spy app. Xnspy is the industry’s leading mobile spyware. It’s the app’s combination of advanced spying features, affordable pricing, and a 24/7 customer support, that all serves up to make Xnspy the best phone monitoring software. Xnspy is not just your surveillance app for the children but for your employees, too. It has everything to keep you updated about their activities in real time. Some of its incredible features include monitoring phone calls and messages, access to instant messenger chats and multimedia sent via these chats, GPS location tracking (this includes monitoring of specific locations, current location, location history and geofencing), email and browser monitoring, recording of phone calls and surroundings, remotely controlling the target phone, and lot more. Xnspy has introduced some few advanced spying features, too, that include Keylogger, Wi-Fi logs and WhatsApp monitoring without rooting. The app keeps on getting better and better. But that’s not all! If your fixation for spying needs a frenzy, keep on reading, because there’s still a lot to be discovered about the best hidden spy apps. It is not just the features of Xnspy that makes it an incredible choice, but also its compatibility. The developers of the app are very good at keeping up with the changes in technology. It is compatible with both Android and iOS devices. For iOS, Jailbreak and no-Jailbreak versions are offered too so that every device owner can use this app without any limitations. Xnspy is an attractive option because of its price, too. It comes in two packages: Xnspy Basic and Xnspy Premium. The Basic Edition costs $4.99 a month and the Premium Edition costs $7.49 a month. These prices, compared to other similar options, are shockingly low. Plus, most of the other phone spy apps that you would read about here don’t have enough to match Xnspy on their features either. Rating: 9.8/10 Flexispy is, without a doubt, one of the top spy apps that works with both iOS and Android. We love Flexispy for its expansive, and some exclusive features, including the ability to access the camera on a phone, keylogging, and so on. And while Flexispy may have a bigger list of features, we weren’t convinced to put this app on the number 1 spot. For instance, some of the Flexispy features are deemed unethical, like its ability to access a phone's camera, or with the keylogger, their passwords can be stolen. And not to forget, Flexispy comes at an eye-watering price of $349. Rating: 9/10 When we talk about parental controls, Qustudio is the name that resonates with us. If you are looking to monitor your children, this might just be the perfect solution. You can set limitations on your children’s screen time, or block apps or websites that they browse. However, an app as good as Qustodio still has a few caveats of its own. For one, you can’t use this app secretively. But why would you? There are many instances where you have to hide from your child that you are overseeing their activity. When kids are susceptible and engaging in dangerous activities online, and know that they are being watched, they might temporarily act normal. If your child is experiencing bullying, depression, or getting exposed to porn, overtly monitoring their activity might not provide you with unbiased results since many children are good at hiding things. Qustodio is very price-friendly. It comes at USD 55 yearly and you can monitor up to 5 devices under a single subscription. Rating: 8.5/10 Here comes another popular mobile spy app of 2021 that helps you record the messages of the victim, their call log, monitor IM chats, web browsing history, keylogger, GPS tracking, geo-fencing, and a lot more. It is capable of running in complete stealth mode so don’t worry, if you want to secretly snoop on someone, this best cell phone monitoring software won’t let you down. The best part is you don’t need to root the device or jailbreak to make it work. It offers some nice and intricate features like video preview and capturing screenshots. Some of these advanced features are not being offered by other spying app vendors. It’s a great app when it comes to features but there are some complaints about its functionality. Android version of Spyzie has two editions. The Ultimate Edition version costs $49.99 a month and it comes with fully functional features. The Premium Version costs $39.99 version but it has restricted functionality. The iOS version’s license costs $49.99 a month. Spyzie appears to be an attractive mobile spying app with tons of features because it is quite pricey. Only the Ultimate Edition offers all functional features. All functions are not operational on the iOS version. Rating: 8/10 MobiStealth is also one of the top 12 mobile spy apps of 2021 that come with a broad range of spying features. It is available in three different packages starting from basic to advanced monitoring features. So the features it is offering include viewing text messages, application list, monitor chat messengers web browsing, track location, emails, pictures, keylogging, surround recording, call recording, and Gmail logging. It offers mobile and computer monitoring, making it a perfect choice for business owners. MobiStealth’s PC monitoring software can help you protect your interests by providing continuously monitoring all online activities. You will be paying around $0.50 a day for these features. No wonder it’s among the best cell phone spy software. MobiStealth supports Android, iPhone and iPad, PC and Mac tracking. For Android Pro: 16.66/ month Pro X: $26.66/month For iOS Premium: $26.66/month Premium Plus: $40/month For Windows: LITE: $13.33/month PRO: $20.00/month For MAC: LITE: $13.33/month MobiStealth’s basic Versions for each of the devices mentioned above offer only basic spying features. You will have to go for the Premium Versions to avail all features. In that case, the app will become really expensive for anyone, whether it is parents or employers and in the long-run, it can break the bank of an average person. Rating: 7.8/10 If you are looking for an office phone monitoring solution or parental control, Clevguard has all the right tools for you. It works with both Android and iOS with extensive social media monitoring on the former. Clevguard also comes with remote controls as that of Xnspy, like the ability to take screenshots or record calls, remotely. Additionally, Clevfguard can take secret photos too, just like Flexispy. All in all, Kidsguard Pro is a great app for your daily monitoring needs. There are no device compatibility-related details on the website but what we do is that Clevguard is compatible with Android, iOS, and PC. Similarly. there’s no definite information on how much it costs to use Clevguard, but on the website, they have mentioned that it will cost you USD 0.27/day. We are assuming this is based on their yearly subscription plan. Rating: 7.6/10 iSpyoo is the mobile spy app meant to check on your employees and protect your children from the hazards of the online world. Since it is a spying app, it becomes completely invisible. The distinguished feature of this top rated cell phone tracking app is that it lets you monitor video calls on Viber and Skype too. Other features it supports include location tracking, read text messages, SMS, view call logs, record calls, view contacts, photos, videos, IM chats, emails, and internet browsing history. There is a free trial version of iSpyoo too. With one account, you can monitor 3 different devices. Cool, right? The only problem is you have to root or jailbreak your device for using most of the features offered by iSpyoo. iSpyoo is compatible with most Android or iOS devices. It does not support Windows or Blackberry phones. In short, it is compatible with any carrier is offering open GPRS internet access. iSpyoo is available in 3 different packages. The higher the package you choose, the better features you will get. Instead of paying a monthly subscription, you can also buy for 3-months, 6 and 1-year subscription according to your budget. Rating: 7.5/10 Here is another mobile spying app for 2021 that lets you monitor all activities on smartphones running iOS, Android and Blackberry. With StealthGenie, you can read incoming and outgoing text messages, emails, call logs, track GPS location, instant messenger chats, remotely monitor the phone and intercept the calls. StealthGenie supports Android, iOS and Blackberry devices. If you want to use StealthGenie on iPhone, you have to jailbreak the device. So, iPhone users aren’t really able to use this app. StealthGenie comes in 3 different packages. Its price is quite competitive. You just have to pay between $8 and $16 per month, depending on the package you purchase. Rating: 7.3/10 NOTE: StealthGenie was a great app but unfortunately, it is no longer available. mSpy is another spy app that is used as a cell phone monitoring app. The app is primarily used as a parental monitoring app. Compared with other apps, mSpy offers a limited number of features. It offers all the basic features that other apps offer, such as monitoring of emails, text messages, browser history, call logs, contact list, multimedia files, location tracking, etc. In addition to this, you can remotely control apps and programs. However, it does not offer advanced features such as call or surroundings recorders. Because of the limited number of features that the app offers, it ranks at number 7 in our list of 12 best mobile spy apps. Users of the app can install mSpy on Android cell phone and tablets. The app is compatible with Android as well as iOS devices. The app is compatible with Android OS 4 and above. To avail the advanced features offered by the app, you need to root your Android device. The app is compatible with all iOS devices from iOS 7 and up. The subscription plans offered by mSpy are expensive. For the number of features that the app offers, the pricing for mSpy does not seem justified. For the Basic subscription plan, you only have the option for a monthly subscription. However, for Premium packages, you can purchase it on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis. The pricings of the subscription plans are mentioned as follows: Rating: 7/10 It is a simple and reliable mobile spy app which common tracking features. If you are looking for a budget option and you don’t need a complicated tool, this one is for you. It lets you access text messages, view call history, photo, videos, track Location, get device information like memory usage, IMEI, browser history, see installed apps, notes, calendars and more. It is compatible with Android and iOS. It only works on jailbroken iPhones. MobileSpyAgent is available in 3 plans; Basic, Pro and Business. The business plan is meant for the users who need multiple licenses and its price is provided as per your spying needs and license requests. Rating: 6.9/10 Appmia is another worthy addition to the 12 best spy apps for phones with its one-time license, ability to monitor two devices at a time, and free upgrades. If you have basic monitoring needs such as call and text message monitoring, location tracking, and access to calendar and address book, Appmia is a good choice. You can monitor a variety of devices with Appmia. Appmia lets you monitor Android devices, iPads, iPhones along with some versions of Nokia Symbian devices and Blackberry phones. Note: The features and functionality varies for each device so, it is better to consult the official website to check the compatibility and access of features. Appmia is an expensive app. Rating: 6.7 /10 Highster Mobile is a popular cell phone tracking application famous for its steal camera, call recording and eavesdropping features. It supports all basic spying features like monitoring call logs, text messages, iMessages, IMs, media files, emails and address book and GPS tracking. It works in absolute covert mode. Its stealth camera feature allows you to take pictures and make videos of the surrounding and view them online. If you want to block an app, a website or uninstall an app, Highster Mobile does not support that. Highster Mobile is compatible with both Android and iOS. Highster Mobile is available for a one-time fee of $69.99. There are no monthly or annual billings. It may not have all advanced spying features but given the features that are being offered, it is a great bargain. Rating: 6/10 The mobile spy app that we would recommend to anyone who is looking for best features, affordability, and reliability is ‘XNSPY’! We have made our recommendation by analyzing and comparing the features of Xnspy with other best spy apps for phones. So, here is what makes Xnspy the right choice: Xnspy works on all latest operating systems for both Android, iPad and iPhones. If you want to monitor an Android Oreo 8.0 device, all features of Xnspy will readily work on it. Similar is the case with Xnspy for iPhone. You will see lots of contenders on the list of top spy apps that either only support Jailbroken iPhones or their advanced monitoring features don’t work on iPhone to begin with. That’s not a problem with Xnspy. It also offers a separate version for devices that are already jailbroken. The developers continue to update the app to keep up with the updates in the operating systems. Xnspy is the best value for money. You might find apps like MobiStealth and Spyzie attractive but after a month or so, these apps become hard to afford for an average person. On the other hand, even the premium edition of Xnspy is the most affordable among all cell phone spying apps if we compare it with the features being offered. Advance monitoring in the form of alerts, geofencing, surround recording and ambient recording come at the price of $14 a month. Similarly, some apps are offering unique features like video call monitoring, keylogger, remote picture and video capturing but to use them, you have to root or jailbreak your device or pay a lot of money. But Xnspy is a package of all essential monitoring features that come at a really affordable price. Customer support provided by Xnspy is quite reliable. They are offering 24/7 live chat support. The website offers tutorials, live demo versions, and comprehensive how-to guides on all features which makes it easier for any user to understand the app. The FAQ section contains answers to most of the questions customers would want to know. However, if you can’t find answers to your queries or you are facing technical difficulties, you will always find support agents to assist you. Xnspy is always on top of the game to hear and address the concerns of its valued customers. Take a look at these features and then see if any app is offering all these at a price that actually is affordable. Xnspy is compatible with most phones and tablets. Android devices with OS 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x. are compatible. iOS devices with iOS versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x up to 15.1 are compatible with the app. Before installing the app on the phone, make sure that it is compatible with the phone. Xnspy is the best hidden spy app when it comes to stealth mode. The app works in hidden mode and is 100% undetectable. The user of the device cannot view the app in the App Listing on the device. Hence, you can monitor the activity on the device discreetly. Xnspy monitors the live location of the device on Android. If the phone is connected to the internet, you will receive regular updates on your account. Xnspy provides details on previous as well as the current location. It includes the address, longitudinal, and latitudinal coordinates. Users can also mark locations as safe or unsafe. Yes, Xnspy is 100% legal. However, the app’s user is responsible for how they intend to use the app. Moreover, if you wish to use the app for monitoring children or employees, the device must belong to you or the company, respectively. For children below the age of 18, the app is legal to be used without consent in most US states. However, we do advise you to check with your local surveillance laws before using Xnspy. To use the app for employee monitoring, the employer must inform the employee. But using the app to monitor your partner, spouse, or any other person without their consent is outright illegal. The data gathered on the device uploads to Xnspy servers. The data can be accessed by the user only, and no one else. To view messages, call logs, contact list, multimedia files, emails, browser history, and other data collected on the device, log into your account. On the dashboard, you can see the device information, including the battery level, and location. On the left-hand side, the list of features is available. To view individual features, click the drop-down icon, and you will find each category of the features offered. Limited Time Offer XNSPY SOFTWARE IS INTENDED FOR LEGAL USE ONLY. XNSPY is a smartphone and tablet monitoring software designed for parents who wish to monitor their children under 18 years and employers who want to keep track of their employees through company-owned smartphones and tablets. The buyer of the XNSPY software must either own the smartphone or tablet or must have written consent from their children or employees. It’s illegal to use Xnspy for monitoring digital devices of your spouse, girlfriend/boyfriend, or partner. Failure to do so is likely to result in violation of applicable law and XNSPY will cooperate with the law-enforcing authorities to the full extent. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the buyer to adhere to the local laws of their country or region. The software is only to be used for ethical monitoring purposes. Online"

Choosing a mobile application development company is the most crucial decision your business has to make in this journey. With a diverse range of options available and a more extensive list of features to choose from, this process can be daunting. Hence, here is everything you need to know about choosing the best mobile application development company for your product. The entire process of creating, designing, and launching software applications capable of running on mobile devices is called mobile application development. It involves creating installable software bundles like codes, implementing backend services, and debugging them. With the growing number of smartphones, tablets, and other devices, mobile applications have become the heart of today’s digital world. They tend to utilize the unique features and hardware of mobile devices, making them a popular medium of software creation. With the steadily growing dependency on smartphones, mobile applications are the key to better customer experience, higher engagement, and more efficient functioning for your business. With a team of well-trained professionals, a mobile application development company aims to offer a complete suite of services, starting from ideation and concept to delivery and post-launch support. Advanced coding services, backend development, dynamic testing, native and cross-platform solutions along with UX/UI design are few of the hundreds of services provided by the companies. Moreover, they also specialize in particular market segments and hence provide expert end-to-end solutions to business organizations. Mobile applications have become an integral part of the growth and expansion of any business. However, if you are still wondering whether the hassle of outsourcing your mobile application development is worth it, here are a few reasons why you should strongly consider doing so: 1. Cost-saving and time-effective: Keep escalating budgets at bay by paying a pre-stipulated amount to a mobile development company whose expertise will ensure that you receive your app in time. IT workloads are off your shoulders and a professional mobile application is delivered to your doorstep saving precious time and money. 2. Expertise: A mobile application development company has a dedicated team of experienced coders, designers, and other skilled professionals who have immense knowledge in key areas like design, usability, and cross-platform functionality. While your internal team may struggle to master the new tools, these professionals are pre-trained and are capable of creating a user-friendly platform to fulfil your requirements. 3. Round the clock support: From developing the idea to providing post-launch services, app developers are 24*7 available to ensure seamless delivery of work. With outsourcing comes the benefit of never missing out on productive working hours due to technical malfunctions. 4. Impeccable security: Along with the quality, clarity, and efficiency of an app comes to its security. Make security someone else’s headache with mobile app development companies that are trained to protect your app against cyberattacks. Robust security mechanisms and tight Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) ensure that your valuable data is never vulnerable to hacking. Once you have decided to build an app for your business, there is an ocean of mobile development companies waiting to lure you into accepting their services. However, before you dive into the short-listing process, you should do your homework to know what works for your business. Here are a few significant things to consider before short-listing mobile app development companies- 1. Market research: The first and foremost task is to vet your app idea through extensive market research. A detailed market analysis report not only gives an insight into your target audience but also studies similar apps present in the market, helping you understand your competitor’s strategies as well as the probable dos and don’ts. 2. Platform: Another crucial task is to select a definite platform to deploy your application, be it iOS, Android, or both. Additionally, a well-researched decision on the types of apps suitable for your industry and a study into their respective pros and cons will help the application developer guide you into creating a high-quality application 3. Budget and time: A detailed estimation of budget, desired time of delivery, and a comprehensive list of available resources are necessary to ensure a smooth running of the process of app development. 4. Monetization model: A clear picture of the money-making strategies from the app based on your business model will enable you to determine the core requirements in your applications. Who says no to profits anyways! 5. Action plan: Since mobile application development is a complex process, it is essential to understand what exactly goes on in each stage and prepare an action plan accordingly. This will allow you to have a clear idea of what you are stepping into and ensures that you have reasonable expectations from the mobile development company. Here is a quick snapshot of the basics of mobile application development that will help you make an informed choice. Different mobile application development companies focus on different operating platforms. Three of the most popular ones are- • iOS: This is Apple’s unique operating system that solely runs the company’s iPhone, Ipad, and iPod. Generally, an app developer uses Swift, objective-c, or Xamarin to design native and cross-platform apps. A recent survey revealed apple users download approximately 51 apps per minute. • Android: Compared to Apple’s closed system, this platform is an open-source and free software stack owned by Google. The native application development platform for Android OS is Java. Based on the country of your target audience, android might be extremely to moderately fit for your requirement. • Windows Mobile: This newcomer is based on the Windows CE 5.2 Kernel used in smartphones and mobile devices. It is increasingly seen as a major player in the operating platforms of the future and is thus chosen by companies looking to leave no stone unturned. There is an uncountable number of apps in the market. However, they are all broadly categorized into the follows: • Native apps: As the name suggests, these types of apps are native to one particular platform and do not operate on other operating systems. They are highly interactive and intuitive. • Hybrid apps: These are an amalgamation of native and mobile web apps that use multi-platform app development frameworks and tools. These are faster and much cheaper to develop. • Mobile web apps: These apps are run directly on web-hosted servers and not on the particular device. HTML, JAVA, and CSS are some technologies used by these apps. It offers greater convenience and a range of emerging features. It is important to use your market research, dedicated budget and industry-knowledge from the earlier steps to have a fair idea of the kind of app you are looking for before you approach a mobile application development company. This will not only allow you to be in the driver’s seat in the process but also ensures that you make informed decisions during the development of your application. Though you may find an exhausting list of platforms to shortlist appropriate mobile app development companies for your business on the internet, it is crucial to note that these lists are meaningless without well-researched criteria and comprehensive data to back their claims. It is important to understand that top-rated companies might not always be your go-to solution as each business looking for mobile application development requires a different level of expertise. Considering these factors along with data analysis of hundreds of expert reviews and on-ground experience in mobile application development, the above list of best-situated mobile application development companies is created to ensure that you don’t have to spend your valuable time surfing through websites. The above list is formulated by experts based on both objective and subjective factors that affect your experience with a mobile application development company and thus provides a one-stop solution to your probing. Here is a list of questions that will help you understand the nature of a mobile application development company during the hiring process: An application portfolio generally consists of a history of applications built by the company for its customers. Asking for an app portfolio gives you a detailed insight into the mobile development company’s expertise. Moreover, the previous level of complexity and type of applications handled enables you to analyze whether the company can meet your requirements or not. A quick look into the customer portfolio enables you to estimate how your experience with the company will be in the future. Customer reviews are precious means to judge the level of reliability that the company promises. After all, a company’s reputation among its clients states everything you must know about its functioning. Transparency with the agency will ensure that you do not have to pay through the nose later. Make sure you understand the payment policies of the company and that they match with your pre-determined budget. Ask for the mode of payment, and its frequency to ensure that available resources match the cost of the project. Sensitive data leaks and hacks are a stab in the back for your PR. Hence ensure that you are fully aware of the company’s security policies and app testing methods. Verify whether the company is up to date with its compliance measures and data security. Mobile applications are weapons that must revolutionize your business, not cracks that break it. It is crucial to have a set plan and a launch date for your business’s app. Do not forget to ask for a tentative date and method of delivery along with a timeline for the project to prevent any unexpected delays. Find out whether your chosen platform is parallel to that of the company’s. Moreover, you should also consider asking whether the developer specializes in Cross-Platform App Development for when you might want to expand your revenue streams. Design and other tools are the ultimate game-changer for your business apps as they boost customer engagement. Therefore, ask your app developer about the tools that will be used and ensure that it consists of a bundle of dynamic technologies that suit your business. Communication is the key to a smooth mobile application development experience. Find out how the company plans to communicate announcements, important decisions, updates, or delays. These are issues, if not communicated on time, can cause altercations, since your business is answerable to several stakeholders. Your business should be competent enough to face any unforeseen situation like inadequate funds, idea failure, or unsatisfactory mobile application development services by the developer. Hence, your exit options must be clearly discussed with your app developer. Request for quick scrutiny of the company’s SLA that will reveal their disengagement options. This is an important question that you should ask since the app development process does not come to an end immediately once the app is built. Find out whether the package supports the maintenance and post-deployment services. Discuss how the company plans to meet future needs like updating the app, inserting additional features, fixing bugs, and how extra charges will apply for the same. More Questions to ask before hiring a mobile app development company 1. Why should we choose you over the other local mobile app development agencies? 2. Would we be signing a service agreement? 3. How do you test the apps? Is there a dedicated mobile app testing team? 4. Do you adhere to the standard coding principles? 5. Would you provide me with a wireframe for free to finalize before going ahead with the project? 6. What about project documentation? Is it included in the plan? 7. Would you be maintaining the app at your end after it is launched in the market? 8. What is your quality assurance procedure? 9. What is the average organization size have you developed apps for so far? 10. What is your process for handling pipelines and projects? 11. What is your process for app development? How different is it from other companies or individual developers? 12. Do you also take up overseas projects? 13. How do you set priorities? 14. What is your team size? Is your team capable enough of handling multiple projects at a time? 15. Where does your company stand in terms of experience? 16. Can you develop cross-platform mobile apps? 17. Are there any particular methodologies do you practice for developing an app? 18. Which framework would you be using for my app’s development? 19. Would you offer your assistance in taking the application live on different app stores? 20. How do we go about any future changes and updates in the app after the app is live? Will there be any downtime during that process? There are numerous factors that need to be considered before you shortlist the best mobile application development company- 1. Portfolio: Go through the company’s online presence, past experiences, customer reviews, and its products to have a clear understanding of its experience and expertise. Choosing an experienced company means that your business can be rest assured of resolving any hiccups during the development process. Quality of service determined through customer reviews and feedback is a significant consideration when it comes to shortlisting companies. 2. Designing and coding standards: Robust design and user experience are factors that make you stand out from the crowd. Hence, focus on your app developer’s application designing capabilities and ask for an app design mock-up. The agency’s level of proficiency in your desired platform for both native and hybrid apps are the basic building blocks for your app. 3. Reliable testing and maintenance: Narrow down your choices by considering the type of app testing services that the companies provide. These are crucial since technical glitches are a common issue post app development. Ensure that the company has powerful maintenance services and the latest bug-fixing strategies. 4. Pricing model: Budget failures can be a real nightmare. Hence, pricing models should be a crucial deciding factor. Clear pricing models and fixed product prices are common green flags that should scale down your choices. 5. Project Timeline and submission: Submission of projects on time and the active in-hand projects of the company are compulsory considerations for a smooth and hassle-free experience. Look for app submission services in your developer’s portfolio to efficiently launch it in the app store. 6. Security standards: Security is the most significant factor that dominates your choice process. Correct evaluation of how each company plans to safeguard the developed apps offers long term benefits for your business. The cost and time of developing an application depend on many features and cannot be ascertained by simple searches on Google. The cost and time depend on various factors and increase as more features and complex technologies are tailored to them. Keeping the difference in mind a recent survey revealed the following costs structure: › Complexity - Simple (must-have core features, basic U1, 1 platform) • Average cost - 50,000$ - $80,000 • Average time (in months) - 3-5 Months › Complexity - Moderate (1 - 2 platforms, basic features and more, complex design) • Average cost - $100,000+ • Average time (in months) - 3-5 Months › Complexity - Complex (2 platforms, advanced features, dynamic design, maintenance) • Average cost - $240,000+ • Average time (in months) - 9+ Months It is important to note that all the above-mentioned data is a general hypothetical assessment keeping in mind just the basic features. The costs of application differ from one location to another as well- › Company Location - USA • Average rate per hour (simple application) - $50 • Average cost (simple application) - $15,000+ › Company Location - Great Britain • Average rate per hour (simple application) - $70 • Average cost (simple application) - $21,000+ › Company Location - India • Average rate per hour (simple application) - $20 • Average cost (simple application) - $6,000+ › Company Location - Ukraine • Average rate per hour (simple application) - $30 • Average cost (simple application) - $9,000+ › Company Location - Italy • Average rate per hour (simple application) - $80 • Average cost (simple application) - $24,000+ However, the best method to estimate cost and time for your application is to request for quotes and timelines from the shortlisted mobile app development companies. This will enable you to compare between different companies and make the final decision. A good app idea is followed by a very obvious question: How much will it cost? Every entrepreneur looks to grab the most robust application possible with the least budget allotment. However, there are various cost drivers influencing the development of these bundles of technologies. It is important to understand these factors in order to develop a fair budget for your requirement: 1. Application platform: Different platform options come with different price quotations and are powerful cost drivers. For instance, the costs of building native apps for iOS are relatively higher than those for Android. The choice of the right platform forms the base of app creation and should enhance the organization’s present applications as well as future proposals. 2. Design and functionalities: Without robust designs and functionalities, your application can never stand out in the crowd. It is quite obvious that the number and complexities of features are directly proportional to the cost of an application. User-centric interface and high-quality designs ensure exceptional app experience. However, they require a considerable investment in both time and effort that influences costs to a great extent. 3. Security and hosting: Saying no to multi-layer security measures is not wise since data leaks and hacks are fatal to a business. Efficient security tools demand considerable investment and are critical for the app development process. Moreover, improper hosting puts an end to the application’s lifecycle and hence acts as an aggressive cost driver. 4. Backend integration and testing: Starting from GPS to widgets, third party integrations improve user experience and are fundamental requirements. However, formulating advanced APIs involves inevitable additional costs. Moreover, powerful bug and other testing options are crucial before the app’s launch and acts as a figurative constituent in determining the cost of applications. 5. Maintenance: The real story in application development begins right after the development process comes to an end, as frequent updates and backend support become part and parcel of the application’s lifecycle. Expenses stretch post-app-launch to meet the requirements of advanced technical assistance for its smooth functioning. It is always better to look before you leap rather than finding yourself in a tight corner later. Here are a few final points that you should consider before you finalize the deal- 1. Company must have a comprehensive understanding of your requirement: At the end of the day, you would want a dedicated team of developers who are heavily invested in your idea. Before ruling out all other mobile application development companies, ensure that the developer is in line with your organization’s goals, mission, target audience, and requirements. 2. Efficient app testing methods before launching it: Technical glitches are harmless until they appear after the app’s launch. Deeply analyze the company’s method of fixing bugs and issues with features before you say yes to the developer. 3. Handling onboarding process after launching the app: If you do not want to lose potential users on your app because it has confused them, make sure to give a final glance at the developer’s expertise in designing a user-centric application. It is important to ensure that the company understands and can simplify the process of installation, registration, and activation. 4. Ownership of application: Before you sign the deal, carefully go through the “work made for hire” contract to ensure that you receive all authority of the application developed like source code, content, and design right after the delivery of the app. 5. Method of communication throughout the development process: Focus on the channels and frequency of communication adopted by the companies because a communication gap between you and the developer directly affects the quality of the developed app Hiring a mobile application development company that understands your product, is skilled and within your budget is the first milestone in a series of milestones required for the successful launch of your application. Here is a list of a few simple things that can help you keep the process efficient: 1. Set review dates and strictly follow them: Do not be afraid to constantly ask for updates on the process and ensure that the hired company knows exactly what is expected of them by the next review date. Be involved in the process and closely monitor the progress to avoid miscommunication. 2. Document everything: From the initial development of the idea to the final stage of application launch, document everything. This will not only help you make better decisions in the future but will also see to it that your initial vision is visible in the final product. 3. Pay on time: Following the payment timeline is a huge part of being a supportive customer. The mobile application development company will have to invest significant resources into your project. Thus, realizing the payment on-time will prevent any delays in delivery and help you maintain an amicable relationship. 4. Welcome changes: If a particular feature or idea does not seem feasible during development, do not hesitate to look for better options that suit your requirement. Mobile application development companies have experts who are trained to guide you in such situations, so don’t forget to ask for their opinions. 5. Be prepared: It is important to understand that irrespective of doing everything right, some glitch or some delay is inevitable. Have a flexible timeline to accommodate unexpected issues with the application and ensure that you have a working relationship with the development company post the launch so that any problem is taken care of immediately.

She has a strong marketing and sales background and loves to work in multilingual environments. Video is an important part of a wider content strategy for many businesses looking to expand their audience and draw in more customers. A broad, well-rounded video content strategy includes more than just the pre-recorded content that takes hours of planning, shooting, and editing. Your strategy should also include some high-quality live streaming content, such as live event coverage, company announcements, and conferences. To give your viewers the best experience when watching your carefully planned live streaming content, you need a top-notch live streaming app that allows you to easily share and promote your content, even recording and storing it for future use. In this article, we’ll cover the basics of live streaming apps, key features to look for when choosing a mobile streaming app for business, and the top live streaming apps available on the market. Think Dacast is right for your live streaming needs? Paired with the best live streaming apps, you can create great-looking, entertaining live streaming content that’s automatically shared with your audience anywhere you want. GET STARTED FOR FREE Try it free for 30 days. You’ll be able to access everything Dacast has to offer your live streaming content without having to sign a long-term contract, pay a hefty start-up fee, or give your credit card information. Please note that streaming app technology and pricing change regularly. This post reflects the most accurate information as of November 2021. A live streaming app is a broadcasting software application that is used to capture, stream, record, and share live streaming content. The complexity and features available with live streaming apps vary from platform to platform. The more basic platforms allow users to simply capture and stream their content, whereas more complex video hosting platforms provide advanced recording, search, and promotional tools. Live streaming apps have different setups. Some operate using only a mobile phone to both capture the live streaming content and send it to the app for streaming. Others integrate with more complex pieces of computer software. Depending on your individual business needs and goals, selecting a live streaming app may require comparing and contrasting a set of specifications and features, or it could simply come down to whichever platform is priced right for your budget. When selecting a live streaming app that will suit your needs, it’s important to carefully consider your goals for your content and weigh them up against the features available on individual cloud platforms. Let’s review the seven key features to look for when trying to find the best live streaming apps for your needs. When users watch your live stream, you want them to have the best, most fluid experience possible. Adaptive bitrate streaming is an important feature that makes a great viewing experience possible. For those who are dealing with poor-quality internet connections, buffering a live stream is a common occurrence. After a while, frequent buffering can cause users to become frustrated and abandon your live stream altogether. With adaptive bitrate streaming, different streams with varying bitrates are served to users based on the strength of their internet connections. So, a user who has a stronger internet connection will be given a higher-quality version of your live stream than someone with a weaker connection. To do this, the video player detects any fluctuations in internet connections and processing capacity, automatically upgrading or downgrading the stream’s bitrate. The user just sees a smooth, great-looking live streaming video. In order for your live streaming app to be able to offer that adaptive bitrate streaming to all audience members, it must first create your stream in multiple bitrates. The right live streaming video app has built-in automatic transcoding, which allows you to push your content out to your audience at a variety of bitrates without ever having to think about it. Multi-bitrate streaming takes the images you collect from your camera, in the RAW files, and automatically transcodes the stream into versions that will be playable on a variety of HTML5 devices and internet connection speeds. This helps you serve up the format best suited for your users without extra work on your part. The HTML5 video player is currently the most customizable and compatible video player on the market. It is important to choose a live streaming app with an HTML5 video player so that you can reach the largest audience possible. The HTML5 video player replaced Adobe’s Flash player and has become known as the “all-device video player.” The right live streaming video app will utilize the HTML5 player to give your viewers the greatest access to your content, regardless of what device or browser they’re using. In order for your viewers to get your live streaming content, it needs to be delivered from your camera and system into their devices. The best, most modern way for this to happen is using HTTP Live Streaming or the HLS protocol. This protocol is used to deliver both visual and audio media over the internet, making delivery faster and more reliable to end-users. The HLS protocol also works seamlessly with HTML5 video player streaming, giving users a great live stream experience on every device. When your camera captures video files, it needs to be encoded into a digital format better suited for live streaming. Once they are encoded, the files are transported from the encoder to your live streaming app or software. Currently, the optimal protocol for the encoder to app transport is RTMP. In order to ensure that your live streaming app is compatible with the most accessible streaming technology, you should ensure that it supports RTMP ingest. This protocol makes it easy for larger files to move across the internet with low latency, providing a stable video stream for users.  Protecting your video content is important, especially if you use live streaming as a source of revenue. Streaming with M3U8 links ensures secure streaming and compatibility. When your video is sent using HLS delivery to an HTML5 player, the streams contain m3u8 links. These links let the video player know where the video content is located for easy playback while also containing a security token. The security tokens regularly check in with your apps live streaming servers, enforcing any security you may put in place for your videos, such as password protection and restrictions. Being able to quickly and easily create live streaming content is essential to achieving your business goals, and there’s no better way to do that than to stream from a live streaming app that supports mobile broadcasting. Rather than rely on a platform that you can only use from a computer attached to a bulky camera, select a live streaming platform that comes equipped with its own mobile app. This allows you to effortlessly capture and stream content wherever you are, so you can have someone filming right in the action on planned live streams, or you can always be ready to go live when the mood strikes. There are dozens of live streaming apps available today, with some better suited for individual users as opposed to businesses. Here’s a breakdown of 20 of the best live streaming apps in 2021.

While Dacast is not, in and of itself, a mobile live streaming platform, you can use your mobile device to live stream over the Dacast platform. Here’s how to live stream from your mobile device using the Dacast platform in five steps. First, you have to select a live streaming app in your phone’s app store that works with Dacast via an RTMP source. Many of the apps listed above support an RTMP connection to Dacast, so selecting the right one is a matter of finding which app works best with your phone and has the features you want. In order to connect your live streaming app to Dacast, you will have to find your live streaming URL and other credentials. To do this, log in to your Dacast account and click “Encoder Setup.” Next, select the “Other RTMP Encoder” tab. You will need both the “Stream URL” and “Stream Name,” as well as your login and password details. Depending on the app that you have selected, you may need to enter both the Stream URL and Stream Name, or just the Stream URL. Some apps also require your username and password to connect. Streaming live content requires a stable, reliable internet connection going to your phone. While the 4G or LTE data connection on your phone may seem to be a logical choice, these connections aren’t often fast enough to stream content. Instead, you’ll need to connect to a wireless network and be as close as possible to the router. If WiFi isn’t available where you are, you may want to consider carrying a hotspot with you that you can connect to in situations where you need a faster connection. As a rule of thumb, you need a connection of at least 750 KBPS, but 2 MBPS is recommended for high-quality streaming. Once you’ve completed all the above steps, you should be able to begin your live stream. Now, it’s time to create your content and share it with your audience. Live streaming content, including newsworthy events, church services, and conferences, is an important part of many businesses’ video content strategies. In order to provide your viewers with the most high-quality live streaming content, you need to utilize the right tools to help you create your live streams in the field. Whether you choose a live streaming app that creates and shares your video on its own or one that connects to another live streaming platform, it’s essential that you find one that works for your needs and allows you to create your content with little hassle and disruption. With Dacast, paired with the best live streaming app for your needs, you can create great-looking, entertaining live streaming content that’s automatically shared with your audience anywhere you want.

January 27, 2015  Does any of these Android apps actually works with DACAST service? I kept getting rejected or failed to connect to server. How do you enter username and password to apps other than broadcast me?  February 3, 2015  Thanks for the article Philline. Netflix app or Hulu, or BBC, etc is great on Android.

Sadly, the younger generation (under 30) will be left out if all of the technology goes down. You want to watch how crazy they go, just take away their phones. Sure glad I am in my 40’s and can think on my own without relying on a cell tower for my brain.  December 16, 2015  Guys this list is great if you’re an iphone . None of these apps work with secured streaming if you’re an Android user. Surely you have something for us as we do represent 50% of the mobile user market.  January 3, 2016  I just checked Live on YouTube by Emoze. It’s far better then those mentoned in this post. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tilda.youtube  January 6, 2016  Add Wirecast Go to the list. The free version only streams to YouTube but the paid $5.99 upgrade would be able to stream to DaCast. http://www.telestream.net/wirecast-go/overview.htm  January 11, 2016  It sounds like the app might not be able to input a login and password, but we are going to be testing it out soon. If it works, will add a guide to it and also mention it on this post. Thanks for the reminder.  January 11, 2016  Amazing insights!  January 25, 2016  For people, who try to find a way, how to create a good quality flagship in this niche (live video streaming application) and make money on it. I advise to check this article “How To Develop a Live Streaming App?” It contains tips and advice which are practical to use. Good luck!  March 15, 2016  I recently started using the Closer app. You should check it out. I find it much more convenient because it’s like a camera app that let’s you record your videos directly to the cloud, and let’s you share it to anyone from your phonebook and/or Facebook — live! If you don’t have the app, you can still view the stream through the link that the streamer will message directly to your texts.  April 12, 2016  Thanks reading us ElenS!

May 31, 2016  Indeed, I did not know about this app. that I will now test . Too bad, it seams like only working with Youtube.  August 3, 2016  This is not bad you have a bad idea. this app will work youtube and facebook for broadcasting your event also it is installation easy.  August 6, 2016  It is not bad, I totally agree with you. Using Youtube or Facebook Live has its own advantages and defaults compared to using a platform such as Ustream, Livestream or Dacast.  August 11, 2016  Have you been able to stream using DaCast and this app?  August 5, 2016  yes  August 5, 2016  Thank you reading us Garry. I think that different options appear to you. You could use Apps. to mirror your phones’ screen to your computer and use this window as a Video Input Source for instance. We cannot recommend any specific App. but I would assume that a quick Google Search would offers you various possibilities.  August 15, 2016  I would say Cameleon 2.0 is by far the best especially if you have your own media server. It is capable of streaming to RTMP media servers like Adobe Media Server. http://www.cameleon.live  August 23, 2016  Thank you for reading us Venky!

These devices include: They manage the programming of apps and engage in various tasks including conceptualization, creating databases, admin panels and APIs, testing, launching products and maintaining them. Moreover, they also handle the design and overall user experience. They can bring your brand’s vision to life and help you stand out from the crowd with a consistent and functional interface. App developers have the tools, techniques and processes to build highly performing and visually appealing apps that deliver an outstanding user experience. So, app development companies plan, design, execute, test and develop mobile apps for brands and businesses across industries to help them grow effectively. App developers are qualified in design, coding and programming which allows them to develop fully functional and user-friendly applications.  The top five languages these experts used in 2020 on a global level are: Some of their primary responsibilities include: 29% of users will immediately leave an app if it doesn’t satisfy their needs. (Google) To ensure an engaging experience, top app development companies conduct in-depth research to determine which features and qualities consumers want in an app. Then, they build an easy-to-navigate platform that is simple and enjoyable to engage with. Investing in user experience ensures that consumers continue to use the app, which ultimately grows the business.  App development companies combine their coding expertise and visual creativity with the latest trends to create attractive apps that engage visitors. To ensure an enticing visual design, app developers undertake a design process that includes: Quality assurance (QA) testing is a detailed form of testing that ensures every feature and functionality works properly. The QA phase of the project entails rigorous testing of the app prototype, where every aspect of the app experience is tested for errors, bugs and usability problems. App developers also use QA testing before releasing new features within an existing app. Ongoing maintenance, support and iteration matters in keeping the app optimized, up-to-date and running smoothly. Top app development companies in the US continue to run diagnostics on launched apps to make sure everything is always running at peak potential. However, very often their skills go beyond coding. So, they also: Generally, app development companies charge per hour and their rates range between $50 and $200. When billed by the hour, the cost will largely depend on the complexity of your app or the number of features and functionalities desired and the number of platforms it will work on. A few other factors that will also influence it are the company’s seniority and size. Some firms offer more billing options, so they could also invoice you per project. In this case, you may pay between: Here are the top five reasons why your business needs an app: People spend 90% of their mobile time on apps. (eMarketer) They use their smartphones to perform different tasks including shopping. And the quickest way for your target market to access your products or services is via their mobile phones. This is why investing in a mobile application is more important than ever. Having an app allows your audience to make purchases from anywhere at any time with just a few clicks on their smartphones. This 24/7 accessibility boosts customer satisfaction and contributes to brand loyalty. To access a website from their mobile phones, users need to open their browsers, type the desired address and wait for it to load. On the other hand, they can access apps with a single click, which makes them a much faster alternative than websites since they load within seconds. Moreover, unlike websites which require an internet connection to load, some apps are accessible offline. A compelling and eye-catching app design will not only help you stand out from the crowd but also build brand recognition. Regularly exposing your audience and clients to your app will result in higher engagement and more purchases since frequently reminding them of your existence will increase their brand recall. One of the biggest advantages of having an app for your business is that you can use it to provide different types of information for your clients. This may include general company info, cost of services, product description and more. However, what’s great about apps is also the fact that they can serve as a marketing channel for product or service promotion. They allow sending special sales, discounts and other push notifications that allow direct interaction with the users. This is why apps are a smart investment. Consumer app spending is expected to hit $156.5 billion by 2022. (App Annie) Apps are a great way to generate additional sales. Unlike websites, they offer unique features that businesses can take advantage of. On the one hand, users can easily save their favorite products into their wish lists. This affects them emotionally and encourages them to make a purchase. On the other hand, businesses can send push notifications while reminding users to revisit their stores and engage with the brand. These little factors contribute to customer retention which is one of the biggest marketing goals for every seller. These are the top reasons why you should invest in an apps developer company: 62% of users would uninstall an app if they face technical issues. (Dot Com Infoway) Poorly designed apps have issues like slow loading times, bugs, errors, freezes and crashes. These ruin the user experience and push visitors away. This ultimately results in losing customers and sales. Professional mobile app development companies in the USA have certain processes in place like writing safe codes, encrypting data and using authorized APIs. When developing an app, security is a priority and these experts will take the necessary steps to keep your sensitive data safe.  According to AppsFlyer, due to uninstalls, the average app loses up to $33,000 a month. The sectors that are mostly affected by this are: While the mobile market is thriving, many users keep uninstalling apps. This most often happens because they fail to deliver an outstanding user experience which is closely connected to the development trends that are changing at a rapid pace. To deliver high performing apps, mobile app developers are bound to implement trends as they emerge. This is how they help brands stay competitive, relevant and successful.  In 2020, there were more than 6.95 billion smartphone users worldwide which means the number of people who access apps is enormous. However, not all of these users are your target market. App developers not only understand the environment you operate in well, but they also have the necessary tools to discover important aspects including their: All these factors will help your partner develop an app with SEO in mind that will be able to reach the right audience, attract quality leads and increase your sales. App development project duration depends on two factors: Assuming that you have screened multiple app developers, found the right partner, established a great working relationship and communicated your requirements effectively, your mobile application development should take: But, keep in mind that mobile application development work never truly ends. Apps should evolve as user feedback comes in and the OS requirements change, as well as scale with the growing user base. Therefore, our advice would be to look for an app development company you can establish a long-term relationship with. Here are a few tips that will help you select the best app mobile developer for your business: Having clear requirements is the foundation of a successful project. So, make sure you define the features and functionalities you would like your app to have to help your team transform your concept into a fully functional product. Specialized companies are experienced in assimilating development processes, trends and design elements to unique brands. This is key to product success. 81% of consumers claim that they need to trust a brand in order to buy from them. So, branding matters for long-term business growth. A consistent and cohesive brand identity across all channels improves recognition, facilitates better user experience and ultimately increases conversions and revenue. This is why proper branding should be included in your app for better performance.  Go through these companies’ portfolios to check their work or ask them to show you some samples. Then, visit their apps and test to see how they perform. These will show you whether the potential partners are capable to deliver fully functional apps and outstanding user experience. See what their previous customers say to learn how reliable these agencies are and whether they are satisfied with their quality of work. Reviews will also help you discover their strengths and weaknesses, their company values and the type of partnership you can expect. RSA’s Fraud Report shows that in the second quarter of 2018, 71% of fraud transactions came via mobile apps and mobile browsers. This seeks attention and requires partnering with a mobile app developer that can deliver a highly secured product. The best mobile app developers are dispersed around the world. This is why you should think about your preferences and decide whether you want to outsource your project to nearshore or offshore development company. However, if you decide to work with a partner that is not close in distance, then make sure you ask how the time difference and language barriers can affect your project. Before you hire a partner, take the time to learn about their individual team members. Understand their work experience, successful projects and even their overall design aesthetic. Plus, take the time to learn what each team member’s expertise is and how dedicated they will be to your project to guarantee the best results. Strong organization, clear communication and a detailed timeline are the hallmarks of a top apps developer company. By sharing their overall process, team structure, programs they use and more, an app design company is telling you that they are confident in their method and trust you as clients. The best app development companies will be forthcoming about their creative and logistical process. Not all mobile app development companies are the same, and it’s important that you do thorough research before deciding on a partner to work with. Keep these questions and considerations in mind when scouting to make your choice easy: Although you should not consider it a key deciding factor, yet it is recommended if you partner with a mobile app developer that has previous exposure to your industry. These experts that understand the environment your business operates well, can meet your expectations better and accelerate project delivery. Find out what the top mobile app development companies specialize in to make sure you hire a partner with relevant experience and skills. Every company in our table has its own strengths and weaknesses and finding the right match for your project will result in a fully functional and highly performing product. Learn which app developers will work on your project and whether they have the required technical skills to execute it. Ask to see their up-to-date portfolios to get an insight into their past work, the projects they have worked on and the results they have delivered. This will help you understand whether they have the necessary qualifications and relevant experience to work on your app. This is a key question to address to understand how stable the potential mobile app development companies are. Learning whether they can retain their employees or not can be an indicator of project success. Obviously, you wouldn’t want to waste your time partnering with an agency that trains newcomers constantly. In the first quarter of 2020, there were almost 1.85 million available in the Apple App Store only. (Statista) With so many apps to choose from, modern consumers have become very much selective in their digital consumption. And to engage and retain these users, you need to ensure outstanding user experience. This is why you should enquire how each mobile app developer approaches this process. The project timeline is a key element of project management. It captures the essence of what the project will accomplish and it helps you understand how long it will take. Creating comprehensive, accurate timelines will allow your app developers to get your project off on the right foot. So, when setting a launch date, they should consider: According to Issuu, the most preferred methodologies among app developers are: Whichever development method these experts favor to use, make sure they fit your business. For instance, while Agile is the gold standard among most of them, it does require regular meetings and closely-knit teams. So, find out how carefully they select their methods and whether they consider their clients’ location since these will define the way you and your company collaborate and the way the process flows. Professional mobile app development companies in the United States will know that client involvement in the development process matters for the project’s success. Thereby, they should come up with a plan of tasks that will speed up the decision-making process and accelerate the delivery of your product. Asking about the intellectual property (IP) ownership will help you understand who will own the source code of your product. In general, the app developer that builds the app owns it. However, you might want to select a company that will name you the owner of your app as your intellectual property. This will grant access to all the files around your application for future use. Work with an app development company that agrees to sign a legal contract. It should define the conditions under which your application will be delivered including: We recommend consulting a lawyer to review the terms and clauses before you sign it. The best app development companies are award-winning, passionate and creative. They push boundaries and drive innovation. They change brands for the better and put businesses on a successful path to results. But not all agencies are equal. They don’t have the same talent or work in the same processes. The best app developer in the world depends on your business needs and goals. And by conducting proper research, you can find the right partner to grow your brand online. ..."

Learn more By John Corpuz January 25, 2021 Find the best email app for your phone, no matter what your needs are The best email apps deliver more than just immediate access to everything that's in your inbox. You can also use a good email client to manage the messages you get, organizing all that incoming mail, so that you're not snowed under by an avalanche of virtual missives. As you should know by now, not all email apps are created equal. From general purpose email app replacements to ones offering customization options, and smart assistance powered by artificial intelligence, we've found 14 email apps you might want to try. Depending on what you're looking for in a mail manager, these are the best email apps for your phone.  Microsoft acquired the excellent mobile email app Accompli in 2014, extensively reworking and rebranding it into the mobile version of Microsoft Outlook. The resulting Outlook mobile app remains a mobile productivity powerhouse, bringing your email, attachments, contacts and calendars into easy reach.  Outlook's built-in analytic engine automatically surfaces important email (across multiple accounts) based on your communications. Quick swipe controls allow you to easily triage your email. It's a great mobile email app, and works with Exchange, Office 365, Outlook.com, Gmail, Yahoo Mail and iCloud email accounts. Over the years, Microsoft has enhanced the Outlook mobile app with new features, such as new Do Not Disturb settings on iOS, which helps keep it at the top of our best email app list.  Google's Gmail is available by default on most Android devices — you can download it for iOS, too, and even make it your default email app if you're running iOS 14. If you're already a heavy user of the search titan's web mail service, Gmail may very well do everything you need.  The Gmail app supports multiple accounts and notifications, while also offering particularly handy tools for organizing your emails. Automatic filters can sort out social notifications and spam mail, and users can get really get down to the nitty-gritty, setting rules for tagging incoming mail by sender and automatically shunting them into folders. In addition to Gmail, the app also supports a variety of IMAP and POP email accounts and Exchange.  Like Microsoft with Outlook, Google constantly updates Gmail, adding such features as an Undo Send feature, customizable priority notifications, and the option to turn off the conversation view mode. The app now includes Google's video chat features as well.  Aqua Mail is a freemium Android email app that offers easy setup for a variety of email services such as Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo; the app also supports email accounts hosted by Google Apps, Office 365, Exchange Online, with calendar and contacts sync for Office 365 and Exchange. Another neat feature is Aqua Mail's integration with a variety of popular Android apps such as Light Flow, Apex Launcher, and Tasker. A rich text editor, widgets, and theme customizations are among the many usability features.  Aqua Mail is free, with a $19.99 in-app purchase unlocking premium features like push mail for Exchange servers and Office 365, support for multiple accounts, and removing the Aqua Mail promo signature and advertising.  ProtonMail offers its users a free, end-to-end encrypted email solution designed to make sure that nobody but you and your intended recipients can decrypt and read your messages. The service uses open source implementations of AES, RSA, and OpenPGP to help maximize security and privacy, and the app has the additional advantage of being ad-free.  While anyone can sign up for a free ProtonMail account and email address, premium tiers offer more organizational features and cloud storage.  Tutanota offers encrypted mobile and webmail clients for users looking for a little bit of extra security in their emails. The service uses AES 128 and RSA 2048 systems in its end-to-end encryption, with optional two-factor authentication as an additional layer.  Free users of this best email app can create their own Tutanota email address, complete with 1GB of encrypted storage. Users looking for a little bit more can subscribe to premium tiers that allow for custom domains, expanded search, and inbox rules, as well as the option for unlimited storage. If you’re already dependent on your existing webmail or email provider, though, Tutanota’s probably not for you.  sIt's been an up-and-down ride for Newton Mail, a very well-regarded, feature-rich email app aimed at pro users that's hit a few rough patches over the years. Newton Mail's original developers were planning on shutting the app down in 2018, only for it to be rescued by phone maker Essential. When Essential went out of business, it seemed like the end had arrived for Newton Mail, too, but a pair of the app's fans have acquired Newton Mail, with an eye toward returning the app to its glory days. It's easy to understand why users are so passionate about keeping Newton Mail around. The app includes a number of time-saving features for managing your inbox, shuffling off newsletters and other distractions to different folders so you can concentrate on your most important emails. Read receipts let you know when your email's been read, and you can also snooze some messages to you can deal with them at a more convenient time. Best of all, Newton Mail integrates with other apps, letting you save messages to places like Todoist, Evernote, OneNote and more. You can try Newton Mail free for 14 days before you're required to subscribe to the app for $50 per year. To ensure that Newton Mail sticks around for the long haul, its new owners are working to make Newton Mail open source so that it can continue to be available even if the third time around for this app doesn't prove to be a charm.  Nine is an Android email app that's a bit more tightly focused than other generic email clients, as it's built around security and support for Exchange's Active Sync. Nine supports Exchange, Office 365, Hotmail, Outlook, and Google Apps accounts. It also features Active Sync, so you connect straight to your mail server, rather than having any of your data stored or indexed through any cloud or third-party server.  Previously an Android exclusive, Nine has since launched an iOS version of the app. The app includes Android Wear support, widgets, an unread mail badge on select launchers, and other features. While the app isn't free, users can try it out during a 14-day free trial.  Airmail is a powerhouse email client on macOS that has jumped to iPhones and iPads, delivering a rich set of features as well as interface elements designed with the latest version of iOS in mind. In fact, you can even select Airmail as your default mail client in iOS 14. The app provides support for Gmail, Exchange EWS, IMAP and POP3 systems, with gesture controls, single or threaded message views, labels, filtered search and more, all synced between your Mac and iPhone. Airmail also plays well with other services, supporting document import from OneDrive, Google Drive or Dropbox and letting you open links in many different browsers; it also features “send to” support for apps and services such as Trello, Evernote, and Pocket.  Edison Mail is an all-in one mobile email app that supports a variety of email providers while also bundling in a handy smart assistant and numerous helpful email management features you'd demand from one of the best email apps.  The app features configurable swipe controls, auto-sorting of email by categories, and a handy bulk unsubscribe feature to help you get off spammy mailing lists. Edison Mail’s built-in AI assistant offers a wealth of helpful features, such as real-time travel notifications for flight delays and gate changes, package tracking and receipt organization.  Edison's app supports Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Exchange, Outlook, Office 365, Hotmail, AOL, and IMAP accounts.  Since its acquisition by VMware Airwatch, Boxer has grown into an all-in-one mobile email app, combining email, calendar and contacts into a single experience, while maintaining Boxer's fast, gesture-powered interface.  Swipes allow you to quickly throw mail into archives, trash, or spam, while menus provide more options like starring mails, adding labels, marking a message as read, and more.  Corporate users get more utility out of the app with VMware's Workspace ONE platform for managing access, security features, mobile workflows and app integrations.  Missive is designed for small businesses and teams that have to work with a shared email account and email collaboration. Tools such as a built-in chat, shared labels, task assignment, filter rules and collaborative drafting mean you can share the workload and make sure everyone is on the same page as far as tasks are concerned. Users can create canned responses, schedule messages, and share content to other apps.  The free tier of Missive offers a 15-day history limit and 3-team member limit for collaboration, with premium subscriptions removing history limits and adding app integrations and other productivity features.  Formerly known as Hop, Spike takes a more conversational approach to emails, displaying your emails in a chat format with messenger-like flourishes such as GIFs, voice notes, location sharing, calls, and drawing tools. The idea is to give your mail client a more natural conversation feel.  In addition to the chat-style emails, Spike offers automatic inbox sorting, a unified inbox for your email accounts, calendars, read receipts, attachment previews, and bulk actions. Spike features compatibility with Gmail, Outlook, Exchange, Yahoo, iCloud, and IMAP email accounts.  TypeApp is a slick mobile email app that features clean design and support for a wide variety of email protocols and services such as Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud, Exchange and Yandex, as well as IMAP and POP3.  The app supports an unlimited number of mail accounts with quick switching and customizable push notifications for each account. There's also a neat \"cluster\" feature that intelligently bundles together related emails for viewing and batch actions.  TypeApp comes with numerous features, such as quick filters, configurable swipe controls, mobile printing, and Android Wear support, all wrapped up in a neat Material design package.  Spark is a nimble email app by Readdle that intelligently sorts incoming emails into quick categories, such as personal, notifications, and newsletters for easy sorting. Gesture controls let you quickly sort through your mail, and you can also pin important messages, create one button quick replies, or snooze messages for later attention.  Spark features integration with a variety of apps and services, and emails can be saved as PDFs for reference. There’s also a nice set of collaboration features for teams to privately share and discuss emails, with shared commenting, drafts and delegation. The app supports iCloud, Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, Exchange, and other popular email providers. Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.

        "body": "Every product was carefully curated by an Esquire editor. We may earn a commission from these links. Disappear into a colorful world of spirited competition on iOS or Android.  Believe it or not, if you own a smartphone and have even touched Candy Crush, you're a video game player. Contrary to what Reddit threads say about \"dirty casuals\" who dabble in mobile games for fun, you stand with us, a perfect and fully formed Gamer™. Welcome to the club. Sure, there are few gaming markets that are as controversial when it comes to microtransactions and over-saturation than the mobile gaming market. But that issue aside, you can find quite a lot of stellar downloads for your handy palm pilot in the App Store (or in Apple Arcade) and for Android. These titles range from free, to flat rate, to, yes, a few with microtransactional systems that ask you to pay for stuff in-game, which is not always a terrible model. You might as well download a collection of the newest releases, retro throwbacks, mind puzzlers, and more to pass the time. So, when you don't have the wherewithal to boot up a console, the mental fortitude to read a book, or the apathy to stare at a wall all afternoon, take your mind off the world with the 20 best mobile games to play in 2020.  GET: APP STORE Free to play If you long for the days of juicing your dial-up connection to waste hours on Adobe Flash-running sites with names like putput4free.com, then the first mobile gaming move to make is adding the GamePigeon extension to your iMessage library. It's loaded with simplistic, time-passing activities like pool, poker, and Connect 4. You start a game with someone over iMessage, and you'll each get an alert when it's your turn to make a move. No flair and no fuss. Honestly, it's a far better way to make memories over digital devices than Zoom. Shit-talking recommended. GET: APP STORE GET: GOOGLE PLAY Free to play If all were fair and just in this world, you'd be able to play Animal Crossing: New Horizons on mobile. But this world is something of a downer. Fortunately, Nintendo preempted the release of New Horizons with 2017's Pocket Camp, which has nearly as much heart as the console title. Collect crap, make friends, dodge loan payments, and furnish your campsite—all that Animal Crossing charm comes to you sans the $60. GET: APP STORE GET: GOOGLE PLAY $4.99 For more one-with-the-earth types, there's the cult-classic farming sim Stardew Valley. Its premise is simple: Inherit a plot of land, tend to its crops and livestock. What makes it joyful is its beautiful art style, its delightful soundtrack, and the engrossing tasks you take on around your farm and the community. You'll likely find if more relaxing than a mug of bourbon hot chocolate drunk next to a crackling fireplace. It'll last longer, too. GET: APP STORE GET: GOOGLE PLAY $3.47/month You might've seen it on Twitter: This honeycomb of letters with the yellow hexagon in the middle, and users jokingly (or genuinely) angry that, per the rules, they can't string together words like \"jawn\" or \"chompion\" or \"grogu\" for points. The New York Times was already a gaming stalwart with its Crossword, but in the last few years it expanded its gaming center to include treats like the daily Spelling Bee challenge, which is good, wholesome fun that also makes you smarter, probably. You can play a limited version without a subscription, but the subscription is recommended. GET: APP STORE GET: GOOGLE PLAY $2.99 A futuristic take on retro arcade game Lunar Lander, this graphically impressive title has you piloting a spacecraft through the atmosphere and onto safe land so that you can save civilization. Deft reactions and an understanding of physics are a boon. Speaking of which: This could be a smart skill to acquire now rather than later, what with the whole \"evacuation of the imploding Earth necessary for human survival\" scenario that's impending, according to every sci-fi book and show ever written. GET: APP STORE GET: GOOGLE PLAY $0.99 I’ve lost so many hours and gained so much gray hair playing these two games, both from Dinosaur Polo Club. They cast you as a road or metro manager trying to help people of a city get from point A to point B. The visuals are gorgeous, and the short-spurt gameplay is addictive for your own commutes. The best part of this game is the total absence of microtransactions, meaning you can play as much as you want for as long as you want. (Mini Motorways is included in Apple Arcade.) GET: APP STORE GET: GOOGLE PLAY Free to Play Nintendo has made some missteps with mobile gaming, and while Mario Kart Tour got some flak for microtransactions, it's honestly not as bad as all that. Mario Kart Tour is an absolute blast to play, and it now even features online multiplayer so you can race your friends—especially those friends who love casual gaming but don't invest in consoles. While it may not come close to the quality of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on Switch, it's still a lot of that relationship-ruining Mario Kart fun that we love to see. The game is free to play, and can remain free to play unless you opt to buy gems to purchase characters from random pipes. While this loot box system is inherently flawed, the game does a solid job of reigning in the odds. It's nowhere near the most offensive microtransaction system we’ve seen.  GET: APP STORE Free with Apple Arcade The sequel to the stellar Enter the Gungeon, Exit the Gungeon hails from the unparalleled indie publisher Devolver Digital. It is a self-proclaimed “Bullet Hell Dungeon Climber,” meaning it features an array of shooting and slashing, with tons of loot and fast-paced progression. I’ve played the hell out of this series on consoles, and now to have it anytime on my phone is a dream come true. Exit the Gungeon is currently only on Steam, Switch, and Apple Arcade, but chances are it’ll grace Android and Google Play in the near future.  GET: APP STORE GET: GOOGLE PLAY $4.99 Hatoful Boyfriend is a pigeon dating simulator in which you can fail at love and die, and really feel like shit about it. It is also from the aforementioned Devolver. If the whole \"pigeon dating simulator\" thing didn't sell you, I’m not exactly sure what will, but it has phenomenal writing and works as sort of a puzzle game, challenging you to unlock all the different endings. It’s hilarious and does not take itself seriously in the slightest—ideal for picking up and putting back down when you need a good laugh.  GET: APP STORE GET: ANDROID Free It’s here, it's there, it's everywhere. You can quite literally play Fortnite on anything. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they ported it to a Speak & Spell. The best part about Fortnite mobile is that it is cross-platform and enables cross-play, meaning you can play alongside your console and PC friends on your tablet or phone, and all your progress, skins, and other in-game assets will unite so you're always making headway. This game is a little tougher to play without a controller extension, and the mobile version is nowhere near as polished as the console and PC versions, but it’s still Fortnite at its core. Plus, it's pretty damn cool that such a sophisticated, 100-player game can run in our hands. GET: APP STORE GET: GOOGLE PLAY Free to Play The whole Monument Valley series is just absolutely beautiful. It’s dressed in some of the most artful and polished visuals in gaming as a whole, let alone mobile gaming. And it's therapeutic, allowing you to lose yourself and focus on something that brings up emotions from limited storytelling. Do yourself a favor and turn your phone to \"do not disturb\" while playing to fully digest it. Monument Valley deserves that. GET: APP STORE GET: GOOGLE PLAY Free to Play This game, the one that lit the world on fire for a summer, still has a surprisingly large number of hardcore fans. While Pokémon GO may not be great for extended periods stuck indoors, it's definitely a title that makes walking and getting out more fun. Plus, Pokémon Home has further integrated with Pokémon as a whole, and Pokémon GO soon will be supported on the Pokémon Home app, so you can collect Pokémon from all titles in one super Pokébank. This game really sparked a whole new wave of Pokémania. GET: APP STORE GET: GOOGLE PLAY $6.99 The sandbox, pixelated builder that took gaming, and even more so YouTube, by storm is available on your phone. And much like Fortnite, it allows for cross-play, meaning if you want to play with your friends who are on PS4, Xbox, or PC, you can absolutely do so, which is ridiculously cool. Now, Minecraft comes at a price tag of $6.99, and while that's often more than people want to spend on mobile games, it's a steal for this title. Minecraft is one of the most chill, relaxing games out there, especially if you play in creative mode. Escape reality for a bit and lose yourself in your block-based world. GET: APP STORE GET: GOOGLE PLAY Free to Play Hearthstone is one of the biggest card-based strategy games out there, and it's the perfect large-scale game to bring to phones. Utilizing characters from the World of Warcraft series, it requires intense, in-depth strategizing, with easy-to-handle controls and some extremely intricate deck builders. If you're into strategy titles, this is a must play. GET: APP STORE Free with Apple Arcade One of the most stylish games of 2019, Sayonara is an action-adventure title that puts a massive emphasis on music and rhythm. It's the closest you’ll get to feeling like you're playing through the experience of listening to an album. This is one of my favorite titles on Switch, and the fact that you can play a title of this artistic caliber on your phone says a lot about just how far mobile gaming has come. The music is great, and the gameplay is an absolute ball. GET: APP STORE GET: GOOGLE PLAY Free to Play Words With Friends is a frustrating spelling game that will make you want to end friendships and accuse your opponents of every type of cheating under the sun. The game encourages players to use only respectful language in the app, which is laughable. Yes, I lost in the first round of a WWF bracket started among the Esquire team. Anyway, it's a nice way to feel a little more connected to your friends and get some Scrabble smack talk going over the phone, especially in a period of social isolation. GET: APP STORE GET: GOOGLE PLAY Free to Play Snapchat recently released a series of games that are playable in group chats—kind of like the GamePigeon extension, but in the Snapchat app. What's shocking is a lot of these games are really fun. There’s a Mario Party-esque title, a battle royale, and my personal favorite, a tennis game, plus a lot more. The games are pretty basic but utilize your bitmoji and some other cool Snap tech thrown in there. All said, it's a fun way to play multiplayer matches with friends without everyone needing to buy a console.  GET: APP STORE GET: GOOGLE PLAY Free to Play Remember how good Marvel vs. Capcom was (before, of course, its most recent release)? Well, this game is the closest you can get to that, just take out the Capcom. It's a great fighter with a ton of deep-cut Marvel characters and some truly magnificent costumes and alternatives. It feels like a title you’d play on a console. If you're a comic book nerd, or, like us, looking for something to do, it's definitely worth a try. Although we’d much prefer to have a true-to-form Marvel vs. Capcom: Contest of Champions.  GET: APP STORE Free with Apple Arcade This one is Tony Hawk's Pro Skater for your phone, kind of. Listen, we’ve made it abundantly clear that we’re skater bois here at Esquire. We talk about skateboarding all day, and we only play skateboarding games. Well, at least, we spend an unhealthy amount of time talking about skateboarding games. Skate City brings back that joy of stringing together combos and then utilizing timing to pull off awesome strings in a much more phone-friendly way. It’s one of our most-played Apple Arcade titles, and is easily worthy of the hype. Prices vary The app stores of the world are stacked with amazing retro titles, including a slew of Final Fantasy, Mega Man, and Sonic games, among other classics. They often come at more of a price than we’re used to, what with the free-to-play or subscription models that most phone games utilize. But it's absolutely worth it to have some of these titles in your back pocket. If I could only give you one mobile game recommendation, this would be it. "

        "body": "The mobile app development industry is continuously evolving. Technology advancements, consumer demands, and a wide range of other factors have a direct impact on mobile app trends. Staying up to date with the latest trends is arguably the most crucial aspect of success in this space. As a member of the Forbes Technology Council, I’m constantly researching patterns and communicating with other tech leaders about gaining an edge.  Mobile app resellers need to keep up with new trends to better serve their clients. The same goes for content creators and producers ready to take their brands to the next level with mobile development.  Are you prepared for the mobile app development changes in the coming year? The list below is more than just a hunch or my personal opinion. I’ve used fact-based research to come up with the top app development trends that will dominate 2021.  The IoT is far from a new concept. But the rise in mobile penetration across a broad range of sectors and categories has created seemingly endless opportunities for the Internet of Things. People have grown accustomed to using technology to improve their everyday life.  The IoT describes the growing network of devices connected to the Internet, providing convenience and automated control to consumers. Smart home technology is a perfect example of the rise in IoT and mobile app development.  Mobile apps can be used to adjust the thermostat in a house from a remote location, lock or unlock a front door, and connect to home security systems. Refrigerators and other household appliances can also be connected to mobile apps.  The global Internet of Things market is expected to reach $222 billion in 2021. $161 billion of that estimate will come from software, like mobile apps.   That’s a 14% increase from 2019. As you can see from the graph, the IoT is poised for steady growth in the coming years with software leading the way. The number of IoT devices out there is growing,  According to Statista, the revenue from technology associated with the Internet of Things will eclipse 1.6 trillion by 2025.  In 2021, I expect to see more mobile app development with the IoT in mind. Household devices, automobiles, display devices, smart devices, and healthcare are all markets to keep an eye on.  It feels like a lifetime ago, but one of my first mobile phones was a flip phone. Mobile phones have clearly changed over the last decade. Touch screens with one or no buttons have taken over the market.  But over the last couple of years, foldable devices have begun making a comeback. 2019 saw the release of foldable devices like the Samsung Galaxy Fold, the Huawei Mate X, and the new Motorola Razr.  These smartphones fold to compress or expand the screen size based on user preferences. For example, a user might make a call with the device closed, but watch a video on a larger screen by unfolding the device.  From an app development perspective, resellers and content creators need to account for these devices when building or updating an app. The idea is that an app should seamlessly adjust its display as the screen folds or unfolds.  Right now, foldable devices are just a sliver of the overall smartphone market share. But this will change in the coming years. According to a 2019 study by USA Today, 17% of iPhone users and 19% of Android users are excited about buying a phone with a foldable design.  According to Statista, roughly 3.2 million foldable phones were shipped in 2019. This forecast is expected to reach 50 million units by 2022. For that growth to happen, 2021 will be a big year for foldables, which means app developers must plan accordingly.  The rollout of 5G will have a major impact on 2021 app trends. For developers, resellers, and creators, this technology is poised to change the way mobile applications are used and created. Take a look at the expected growth of 5G smartphone connections over the next four years.  2021 will have roughly 3.5 times more 5G connections than in 2020. These connections will nearly triple by 2022. What does this mean for mobile app development? Speed and efficiency will drastically improve. In fact, 5G is expected to deliver a 10x decrease in latency, while boosting network efficiency and traffic capacity. Compared to 4G, 5G will be up to 100 times faster, depending on the mobile network operator.  The penetration of 5G will ultimately boost the functionality of mobile apps. This will allow developers to add new features to apps without negatively affecting the app’s performance.  Developers and mobile app resellers should also use 5G network speed during the testing and development stages of building an app.  Wearable technology has been trending upward for years now as well. This isn’t necessarily a breakthrough in the market. We’ve seen smartwatches, trackers, and fitness bands for a while now. But wearable devices have yet to reach their full potential.  Take a look at this graph from eMarketer about the penetration of wearables in the United States.   While we’re not seeing a staggering jump year-year-over year, the growth is still steady. The wearables trend has changed and will continue to change the way that mobile apps get developed. For instance, Apple made a big announcement about wearables and app integration at WWDC 2019. The new watchOS 6 has brought the Apple App Store to Apple Watch. Independent apps are being built specifically for these devices. This has created an enormous opportunity for app resellers and content creators. In 2021, more mobile apps will be made with wearables in mind. Users will be able to download tens of thousands of apps directly from their wrist.  We’re just beginning to scratch the surface with wearables and mobile app integration. The coming years will be exceptionally progressive in this category.  Beacon technology has been embraced by a wide range of industries. From retail to healthcare and hospitality, beacons can add advanced functionality to nearly any mobile app. The first mobile app beacons were developed back in 2013. But over the last few years, significant advancements have been made to this technology.  Here’s an example of how beacons work with mobile apps. Let’s say you’re a mobile app reseller that builds apps for retailers. Your clients can install beacons in their stores that connect with a user’s smartphone via Bluetooth if the app is on their device. When a user passes by a beacon, they can be instantly notified about a sale or special on products in that store. Beacons can also help track buyer behavior in stores. They can detect if a user is spending a significant amount of time in a particular aisle. The app can automatically trigger a push notification to entice a sale at a later date related to those products.  The main benefit of beacon technology is proximity marketing. It ultimately improves the customer experience within a mobile app. According to Statista, the beacon technology market is increasing at a compound annual growth rate of 59.8%. The estimated market value will reach $56.6 billion by 2026. That’s more than ten times higher than the $519.6 million worth from 2016.  I can’t make a list of 2021 app trends without mentioning mobile commerce. This trend has been dominating 2019, 2020, and will continue to thrive in 2021. It seems like everyone is leveraging mobile apps to increase revenue. From large retailers to individual content creators and personal brands, there is plenty of money to be made in this space.  Mobile ecommerce functionality is a top feature for mobile app resellers to showcase during client pitches. It seems like every day another business is launching an app to drive sales. We’re not quite at this point yet, but we’re almost reaching the age where you need a mobile commerce app to stay competitive. Every single person and business selling online is competing with giants like Amazon. To keep pace, you need to replicate what makes those brands so successful; an app is at the top of that list.  By the end of 2021, more than 72.9% of total ecommerce sales will come from mobile devices. Apps play a significant role in the current and future success of mobile commerce.  I could go on for days listing dozens of trends about mobile commerce. But in an effort to keep things brief here, you can check out our complete guide to mobile ecommerce statistics.  2021 will continue to be a big year for ecommerce app development. Plan accordingly.  Artificial intelligence and machine learning both penetrated mobile app development years ago. But we’ve only just begun to scratch the surface with how these advanced technologies can be used.  When we first think about AI, virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa come to mind. However, the use cases go far and beyond this for app development. Last year, Apple released Core ML 3. This latest version of the iOS machine learning framework was built to help developers embed AI technology into their apps.  Examples of AI features that can be implemented into a mobile app include: Artificial intelligence can make apps smarter, and ultimately improve the performance at every level. From the backend development process to the frontend user experience, AI will change the way apps are built-in 2021.  We’ve already discussed the role of mobile commerce for app development in 2021. But the way people pay using their mobile devices is evolving as well. Mobile wallets like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay are trending upward.  According to a recent report, there was $6.1 billion worth of transactions from mobile wallets in 2019. This is expected to reach $13.98 billion by 2022.  In short, the mobile wallet market should double in the next two years.  Smartphone users are slowly but surely adopting mobile payments. They’re even leveraging app functionalities for payments on connected wearable devices. In coming years, all the mobile apps out there need to account for mobile pay. Mobile wallets must be taken into consideration for app development in 2021. Wallet integration should become a standard feature for every app that processes transactions. Currently, that’s not the case. But the mobile wallet penetration rate in apps will grow significantly in the coming years.  Augmented reality will continue trending upward in 2021. Mobile apps can use AR features for a wide range of use cases. Pokemon Go paved the way for AR in mobile app gaming. But today, the applications for AR have become more practical for other apps as well. L’Oreal Paris uses AR for their Style My Hair app.   The app uses AR technology to showcase different hair styles and colors directly on the user. L’Oreal has also created a virtual makeup app using AR to see what makeup looks like on the user’s face.  Even Google Maps rolled out a feature called “Live View” where users can see turn by turn directions in real-time on real-world imagery. By pointing the device’s camera at buildings and street signs, the app can figure out exactly where a user is.  While these examples may not necessarily be useful for the majority of apps developed in 2021, there are plenty of other ways to use AR in mobile apps.  For example, workforce apps can use AR-based training programs for employee learning.  AR adaption is a top app development trend for content creators. You can use this technology to get creative as Instagram and Snapchat do with face filters.  Virtual reality is also shaking things up in the world of mobile application development. This is especially true for gaming apps. VR technology can connect with phones, apps, and wearables to enhance the gaming experience of fully functional mobile apps. In terms of virtual reality and AR, these mobile application development trends cannot be ignored if you’re in the industries mentioned above. Chatbots have been around for more than a decade. I remember my first interactions with these bots in the late 1990s on AOL Instant Messenger. Over the years, chatbots have evolved and become much more advanced. Chatbots on websites have increased in popularity due to consumer demand. It’s becoming the new standard of customer service. But of the millions of apps available on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, just a small fraction actually use chatbots. This will change in 2021. Since chatbots are driven by AI technology, their responses are becoming more human-like. We already discussed how AI will continue to trend upward, and this is one of the reasons why. The global chatbot market is growing at 24% each year. It’s expected that 25% of all customer service tech interactions were facilitated by virtual assistants in 2020. For this to happen, chatbots need to penetrate the mobile app development market.  Everyone is susceptible to cybercrime. From singular content creators to multi-billion dollar enterprises, nobody is immune.  Malware attacks designed to harm mobile devices increased by 54%. More than 60% of fraud originates from mobile devices. Of that figure, 80% comes from mobile apps.  From an app development standpoint, you can’t afford to take any shortcuts when it comes to securing your app. If you’re an app reseller, security needs to be a top priority for your clients as well. App users are well aware of security risks. So moving forward, people think twice about sharing passwords or providing sensitive information to third-parties, like app developers.  Developers will start implementing features like Sign in With Apple to mobile apps.  Rather than forcing app users to fill out form fields with their name, email address, and password, they can simply create an account and sign in using their Apple ID. These accounts are protected with two-factor authentication, and Apple won’t track the activity.  Here’s another mobile app development trend that will shake things up in the mobile app industry. By leveraging technology for machine learning, AI, data mining, and modeling, predictive analytics can forecast events using data.  Tech giants have been leveraging predictive analytics for years now. A simple example is Netflix. The platform offers TV show and movie recommendations based on what users have previously watched.  In 2021, predictive analytics will be implemented on a more mainstream level, for a wide range of mobile apps. The primary purpose will be to enhance the UI/UX with an app. Take a look at how businesses across the globe are using AI technology.   19% of companies use AI for predictive analytics, which ranks first in the marketing category and fifth overall.  The idea here is that no two users will have the same experience with an app. Product suggestions and preferences will be presented differently based on each user’s actions and behavior history.  On-demand mobile app development is trending upward in 2021. Apps like Airbnb and Uber have shown how successful apps in this space can be.  Users spend $57.6 billion per year using on-demand services. These are some examples of how apps can transform the on-demand industry: The opportunities for on demand apps are seemingly endless. As a mobile app reseller, this is a huge opportunity for you to widen your customer base. By leveraging on-demand capabilities, your clients can add advanced functionality to their apps, which will increase profits for everyone.  While cloud technology is not new, it hasn’t quite penetrated the mobile app industry to its full potential just yet. But this is a mobile app development trend that you definitely need to keep an eye on. Cloud computing has a wide range of possibilities for mobile development, which will be exploited in 2021.  Cloud storage technology can improve the performance of mobile apps at the user’s end. Apps can store data and carry out complex tasks on the cloud, as opposed to storing information directly on the user’s device. Not only does this streamline development operations, but it’s also a cost-effective development solution.  By the end of 2021, 83% of enterprise workloads will be cloud-based. If your agency is building business apps or internal workforce apps, you need to keep an eye on cloud computing trends in 2021.  Android Instant Apps launched a few years ago. But we’re going to see a rise in usage and development in 2021.  Android Studio allows developers to build instant app experiences to improve their app discovery. Users can try the app without installing it. They just need to click on the “try now” button.  Instant apps have size restrictions, so it won’t necessarily be a full version of the app. But these limitations could change in the coming years. App users demand a better experience. Allowing them to use an app without downloading it is a great way to give them that.  Hollar, a mobile commerce app, was able to increase conversions by 20% by launching an instant app. 30% of their entire Android traffic comes from the instant app.  If you’re developing apps for the Google Play Store in 2021, you need to have an instant version as well. Mobile app development is constantly changing. If you’re building apps today using information from two or three years ago, you won’t be able to stay competitive. Mobile app industry trends can make or break the success of your project. As a reseller or mobile app development company, you can treat the 2021 mobile app trends like your bible. This is how you can gain an edge in your space. All of the mobile app developers on your team need to understand mobile app development trends and incorporate them into the app development process. You don’t necessarily need to implement every single trend into every app you build. But you need to have a general understanding of how the market is shifting so you can adapt accordingly.  Based on my extensive research, the 15 app development trends that I outlined above will dominate 2021. "

Hire mobile app developers adroit at creating Ai-powered apps on a full-time, hourly, or project-by-project basis and manage them as an extension of your staff to create a feature-packed app. Apps for food delivery are not a new concept. It’s been a while since they’ve made an appearance in people’s daily lives and phrases like ‘I’ll Swiggy in my lunch and Zomato that steak’ has slipped into our daily vocabulary. Covid-19, on the other hand, has boosted the rise of meal delivery applications. So now is the ideal moment to try your hand at developing a meal delivery app with some fresh ideas. For instance, an app that employs augmented reality to produce interactive menu cards to help consumers make better ordering decisions. This would give your food delivery app a new dimension and attract more clients. Mobile health technology better known as mHealth gives healthcare providers all the necessary information they may need at their fingertips. It also empowers patients to get engaged in their own healthcare. Doctors, patients, and healthcare providers have all benefitted from digital healthcare services. Doctor appointment apps are a valuable mobile app concept that may assist all parties involved to save time and effort. It might be an app that allows patients to arrange appointments on their own or through a physician. Patients would save time and money by not having to drive great distances or wait in big lines if they use such booking apps. The creation of doctor appointment apps is on the increase, and now is the best moment to invest in one. Payment apps based on the Unified Payments Interface, or UPI, are all the rage these days. It’s a real-time interbank payment system that lets you send and receive money. Money may be sent/requested using account number/IFSC code, cellphone number, virtual payment address, Aadhaar number, and even QR code if many bank accounts are linked to a single app. For nearly 6 million years, our forefathers have wandered this planet. As a result, the type of illnesses they discovered differs from place to location. People nowadays travel extensively outside of their hometowns. As a result, the basic components for such age-old Granny treatments may not always be available. As a result, the app concept to create a separate healthcare app was born. We offer an app that has a database of all home remedies, which is organized mostly along regional and cultural lines. The user’s present location will determine the type of medicine he or she can try. There’s also a requirement to categorize treatments according to their symptoms and illnesses. As a final resort, “call the doctor” can be included. Some of the big players in the market are PharmEasy and Netmeds. The fitness app can help fitness enthusiasts keep track of their daily calorie intake and workout condition. You can incorporate a chat feature that allows users to communicate with health experts and other members of the community. MyFitnessPal and Adidas Runtastic have changed the complexion of the industry by empowering the average joe to strive for fitness. People no longer think twice about conducting online purchases thanks to the Classified App. Buying and selling items online has grown quite prevalent in recent years. The popularity of classified applications such as OLX, Quikr, eBay, Go Local Classified and others demonstrates this. Classified applications are more adaptable and have a wider reach than e-commerce apps. Whether you have products to sell, want to assist people in finding the right buyer/seller, or want to use classified app development for marketing purposes, classified app development has you covered. Taxi app services have been in high demand since the start of Uber. Online taxi services will be used by 1588 million individuals by 2024.

The level of services you provide will determine the app’s success. Taxi app development is a viable industry to go into if you can guarantee high-quality service. Many shop owners and members of the general public have security systems installed in their homes. This program will use wi-fi to operate all these security devices, allowing the user to answer the door, examine camera video, and monitor locker/safe activity all from their smartphone. This is an idea that can be realized via the use of IoT app development and Blockchain development. For music enthusiasts, this may be one of the finest app ideas. This app will appear to be a standard mp3 player at first glance, but it will offer much more. It will notify people in the user’s contact list of what they are listening to, and if they like it, they will be able to share it with them so that they may both listen at the same time.

        "desc": "6 Games and Apps That Pay Real Money 1. Swagbucks ($5 Bonus) Where to play: iPhone, Android, and Swagbucks.com How much can you earn: $2 - $4 per hour How much does it cost to play: $0 for most ...",
        "body": "Written by TJ Porter Modified date: Jun. 3, 2021 Everyone could use some extra cash but it can be hard to find a good way to earn more money in your spare time. Plus, many side hustles can be difficult or frustrating to manage and few of us want to think about doing more work after we get home from a hard day at our full-time job. While they won’t make you rich, there are many apps that reward you for playing games or completing simple tasks on your phone. Some of these apps pay real money to the people that use them. There are dozens of these apps out there and, yes, many of them are sketchy or scams. But there are a few that are not only legit but worth it. You won’t be able to replace your full-time job with these apps but they can give you some extra pocket change so you can treat yourself to something nice. Table of Contents: Table of Contents: Swagbucks is one of the best-known websites and apps that rewards its users. It’s easy to sign up for the service and you can use it from any major phone or from your computer. The site offers a wide variety of ways to earn rewards points, which are called Swagbucks. You can take surveys, search the internet, watch videos, sign up for offers like free trials of different products, or use the website’s shopping portal to earn rewards when you make purchases online. Swagbucks’ games hub provides a few different categories of games, including Cash Games. You can play these games for free, but you won’t earn anything. If you’re confident in your skills, these games offer player-vs-player competitions with cash prizes. The catch is that you have to pay an entry fee to play. If you win, you can make a profit but you’ll lose your money if you lose the game, just like any gamble. But Swagbucks will give you a rebate of some of your entry costs. For example, you might get 4 Swagbucks (worth 1 penny each) for every dollar you spend on entries. Swagbucks also offers free games to play that help you earn a few Swagbucks each day, as well. Finally, you can earn Swagbucks by downloading and playing games on your phone. For these, you have to sign up for the offer on Swagbucks’ site, download the app, and meet certain requirements, like reaching a minimum level, to earn the reward. Visit Swagbucks MyPoints is a website that is very similar to Swagbucks, offering rewards for activities like taking surveys, watching videos, and playing games. MyPoint has more of a focus on earning money when you shop, rewarding you with as much as 40% in points when you shop at a partnered retailer’s store or website. The site also offers coupons that you can use to save even more when you shop. If you want to earn rewards while having some fun, there won’t be games but you can fill out MyPoints’ surveys or answer poll questions on the site. These actions will help you build up some points without having to spend any of your money. You can cash out your MyPoints for money sent to your PayPal account or you can redeem them for various retailer gift cards. You can also convert your points to United MileagePlus miles, letting you save some money on your next flight. Visit MyPoints Mistplay is an Android-only app that rewards you for playing different games on your phone. When you download and open Mistplay, you’ll be greeted by a list of different games that are available to play. You can choose any of the games listed, download it, and start playing to start earning rewards. Mistplay has three different reward currencies you can earn: GXP, PXP, and Units. PXP, or Player Experience Points, are tied to your account. You earn PXP whenever you play a game through Mistplay. Having higher PXP levels will also increase the rate at which you earn GXP. GXP, or Game Experience Points, are tied to specific games that you play through the app. The more GXP you have in a game, the more Units you’ll earn from playing that game. If you move to a new game, you’ll start at 0 GXP for that game. GXP doesn’t expire or degrade, so you can always return to games you’ve played in the past. Units are the currency you can redeem for rewards like gift cards. How many Units you can earn will vary from game to game and with how much GXP you can have in a game. Games can offer varying levels of Units from one day to the next, so while specializing in one game can be a good way to build GXP, you might be able to earn more from playing different games. In general, you’ll earn $3 to $5 per hour and can redeem your rewards once you’ve earned about $5 worth of Units. On some occasions, you can boost your earnings by completing streaks of playing a game consistently playing or by competing in contests. Learn More: Can You Really Make Money Taking Online Surveys? Publishers Clearing House is best known as that company that shows up at people’s houses with oversized checks, but it also runs a phone app and website on which you can play games. One thing that makes Publishers Clearing House different from the other apps and sites on this list is that you won’t be earning guaranteed rewards. You can’t play a game for an hour and know you’ll earn $3. Instead, playing games online or through the app earns you entries into Publishers Clearing House’s different contests and giveaways. These giveaways include multi-million dollar drawings and instant-win or online scratch-off games worth hundreds or thousands of dollars. The odds on most of these games are long, so you probably won’t win anything in most cases. Still, these games can be a fun way to pass the time and there is a small chance that you win one of the major contests, which could be life-changing. Related: Best Apps That Can Make You Money Long Game is another unique app that rewards you for playing games. The base of the Long Game app is a checking and savings account. These accounts work just like checking and savings accounts at other banks. The savings account pays 0.1% APY and the checking account doesn’t pay any interest. When you deposit money to your Long Game savings account you’ll earn coins. You can also sign up to have debit card purchases rounded up to the next dollar, automatically depositing the excess to savings. This lets you earn coins each time you make a debit card purchase. You can redeem coins to enter sweepstakes or play different games in the Long Game app. If you do well in the games you can win cash prizes. Some of the games offer hundreds or thousands of dollars in cash prizes and Long Game’s sweepstakes have awarded up to $1 million in prizes in the past. If you win, Long Game deposits the money directly to your account. While Long Game can be a fun way to gamify your savings and earn some extra money by playing games, it’s worth considering the opportunity cost. Many online savings accounts offer interest rates higher than Long Game’s 0.1% APY. You may find rates as high as 1% APY as you’ll do at Chime. Depending on how much you have to put in your savings, you might earn more from a higher interest rate account than from playing games in the Long Game app.   Related: Awesome Sites to Find Odd Jobs That Make Good Money Givling is a trivia app available for iPhone and Android that offers cash rewards and helps people with student debt repay their loans. There are two ways to win money through Givling. The first is by playing in Givling’s daily trivia games. You can play up to twice per day. Each time you play you’ll join a three-person team and answer true or false trivia questions until you finish the round or miss too many questions. Each question you answer correctly earns you points. If your team has the highest score at the end of a competition period, you’ll split the cash reward. The second way to earn is by playing daily games, which earns you queue points. Givling operates a crowdfunding queue for people with student loan debt. You’ll see advertisements when you play Givling’s games. The company takes some of the revenue from these ads and uses it to pay large portions of players’ student debts. You can also complete sponsor offers to earn queue points. As you earn queue points, you’ll move up the queue to get up to $50,000 of your student debt paid based on the number of queue points you have. The company has paid almost $7 million of people’s loan debt so far. Givling doesn’t offer guaranteed payouts, making it more like the sweepstakes or lottery, but it’s a fun way to play some trivia for free and gives you the chance to win big. These are some of the most frequently asked questions about playing games to earn money. When designing this list, we considered two primary factors: how much can you earn and is the app fun to use. The point of this article is to list apps that you can use and games you can play to earn some extra money. If you can’t make any money or if it takes hours to earn pennies, then you might as well be playing a different game that you enjoy more. The games that reward you also have to be fun. It isn’t worth the effort to slog through something that isn’t fun for a reward of a few pennies. There needs to be a good mix of potential reward and entertainment to make these apps worth using. Other factors, such as user reviews and experience, as well as how easy the app is to use, also played a role. No one wants to use a broken or out-of-date app to try to earn rewards because the annoyance of dealing with a faulty app isn’t worth it. Unfortunately, there are lots of scams in the market of games that pay you to play. One good sign of a scam is games that make you pay money before you can participate. At best, these games are gambling and highly-skilled players are likely to have a huge advantage. You’ll be more likely to lose money than make it with these games. At worst, these games will take your money and make it almost impossible to earn rewards or cash them out. Some apps that give you rewards for playing other games on your phone also try to steal your data. Be very careful about which applications you install on your phone and follow security best practices. Check the reviews for apps before you install them and don’t give them more access to your device than is absolutely necessary. While there are many scams in the getting-paid-to-play market, not all of them are scams. The apps on this list are perfectly safe to use and a good way to earn some extra cash by gaming. Use your best judgment and do your research before installing any app or giving the app access to your device and you should be safe to game and earn some cash. Playing games on your phone won’t make you rich but there are a few options out there that let you have fun and earn some extra cash. Don’t expect them to replace your day job but they can help you afford a nice lunch out or subsidize your daily coffee habit.

Our editors independently research, test, and recommend the best products and services; you can learn more about our review process here. We may receive commissions on purchases made from our chosen links. What's most important to you when picking a mobile banking app? You may want top security so that you can rest assured that your accounts will not be compromised while you're using the app. And basic features like depositing checks with the click of a button and viewing your balances in real-time are always great. But what seems to matter most is ease of using the app and top-rated customer service. The mobile banking apps listed here are free to download on both Apple and Android devices, though of course your cellphone carrier's messaging, and data usage fees do apply.﻿ The following apps are all excellent, so they aren’t ranked, but listed in alphabetical order instead. By existing online-only, Ally Bank can offer higher rates and lower fees than other traditional financial institutions. You'll have access to over 43,000 ATMs in the U.S. that you can use for free as well. Ally is currently one of the top-rated banks offering interest checking accounts, which is not a common product. It also provides a high-yield savings account with a competitive APY that stacks up well against all banks.  What We Like: You can perform all of the basic tasks you've come to expect from a banking app, like bill pay, finding an ATM, mobile check deposits, reviewing your transaction history, and opening the app with your fingerprint rather than a password. The format of the app itself is fresh and easy to use, and you can link additional Ally accounts like a CD or IRA for a more straightforward review. As a bonus perk, you can read up on stock market news directly from the app. Also, Ally uses Zelle, which allows you to transfer money within your Ally accounts or between your Ally and non-Ally accounts. What We Don't Like: Customer reviews show android users are less satisfied than iPhone users. While it's not a con of the app per se, there's no way to deposit cash into your Ally account, despite robust ATM access.  A large national bank with about 17,000 ATMs across the country, Bank of America is a trusted name in finance. Its financial services are basic, and you're not going to get any crazy high rates on your savings accounts. But, it offers great technology and savings tools to its customers. What We Like: If Bank of America notices a suspicious transaction, it will send you a notification right away so that you can verify or decline it. You will then have up to 60 days to do so. You can easily link your Merrill Lynch brokerage account to the mobile app and even view that info directly from the accounts tab. In the AmeriDeals section, you'll find local cash-back opportunities, which can be a fun way to earn rewards while en route, such as during your morning or evening commute.  What We Don't Like: While the functionality is all there, the appearance of the app is nothing to write home about. Make sure to mind your balance, too, as you need to maintain a monthly account minimum if you want to avoid the monthly maintenance fee of $25, and you can be hit with a $35 overdraft fee up to four times a day if you're not careful. If Capital One is in your wallet, then you have access to a slightly quirky, but highly rated, banking app. Customer reviews show android and iPhone users are close to equally satisfied. Capital One as a bank consistently ranks high in customer satisfaction and offers a high-yield savings account with a very competitive APY. What We Like: If you have other Capital One accounts, like loans or credit cards, you can view and manage them all in the app. You can use your accrued reward points to pay yourself back with a statement credit and if you temporarily can't find your credit card, you can lock access directly from the app. You can undo the move if you end up finding it, which saves you the hassle of canceling your card only to have it show up a few days later.  What We Don't Like: With so many features, sometimes it can feel like information overload if all you want to do is check your balance.  You may not have heard of Huntington Bank, but it is the only banking app to receive full marks in the 2021 J.D. Power survey for all of the categories: overall satisfaction, ease of navigation, appearance, availability of key information, range of services, and clarity of information.1 The bank is based in the Midwest and consistently delivers high customer service. What We Like: In addition to standard features, you can set up push notifications that inform you when transactions have occurred in your account. You also don't need to log in to see your account balance. And if you accidentally overdraft money from your account, the 24-Hour Grace feature gives you 24 hours to deposit money before facing the fee. What We Don't Like: There isn't much not to love about the app itself. However, customers in some regions might have trouble finding ATM access—Huntington only has branches and ATMs in seven Midwestern states. Another large financial institution with a vast network of ATMs and locations is Wells Fargo. It offers low fees on checking accounts that are easily waived if you have a $500 minimum daily balance, direct deposits of $500 or more per month, have a linked Wells Fargo Campus Card, or are between 17 and 24 years old. Wells Fargo also has over 13,000 ATMs and more than 7,200 branches across the country, making it easy to access your money. What We Like: Paying your bills is easy through the app and you can set up Touch ID or Face ID to access it without your username or password. For the technophobes who would rather go old school (or just don't want to be bothered to open the actual app), you can use text banking commands. For example, type in BAL to get your account balance, ACT to see recent account activity, and DUE to look at your credit card account information. What We Don't Like: Wells Fargo has pretty low rates on savings accounts. Even though its app is top of the line, you may want to look elsewhere for your savings needs.  A banking app is a mobile app where you can access the details of your bank account and complete transactions directly from your phone, tablet, or mobile device. Based on the bank you’re accessing, you’ll be able to complete a variety of actions via your banking app. Most banking apps allow you to view your current balance and transaction history, deposit checks up to a certain dollar value, initiate transfers to other bank accounts, schedule payments or pay your bills, send person-to-person payments, and locate ATMs that are free for you to use.  Generally, you’ll have to download your banking app via an app store such as Apple’s App Store or the Google Play Store. After you’ve downloaded and opened the app you’ll be asked to log in to your account using the same login information you use to access your bank account online from a web browser. Once you’re logged in, the experience will be different based on the banking app you’re accessing, but generally, you’ll be allowed to select the task you want to perform, such as viewing your balance, looking at your transaction history, or making a mobile deposit.  The banking app is designed to work in a similar way to any transaction you’d complete at the bank that doesn’t involve cash. The hope is that you’ll be able to access your account and get your financial needs serviced easier and more quickly than you would if you had to go into a bank to complete the task. You cannot open an account from most banking apps, however. Banking apps are free to download and use, but the costs for managing the app might be passed on to you by the bank.  It’s not common to be charged for mobile app access, but if you are, then it will likely be a fine-print item in your bank account documentation. Most banks will just factor in the cost of the app to their overall operating costs so you’ll never really know what you’re paying for it.  The features you need in a banking app will depend on why you’re using the bank account to begin with.  Most individuals will need some basic features, which should all be pretty standard in most big bank mobile apps today. These features include the ability to view your balance, see at least 90 days of transaction history, pay bills online, make person-to-person payments, schedule payments, arrange one-time transfers to other accounts at your bank as well as third-party banks, deposit checks, and contact customer support.  If the banking app doesn’t have at least these features then it might not be a very robust offering. Generally, yes, most banking apps are extremely safe to use. The banks have to have a good deal of security regardless of what features their mobile app offers. If you’re already accessing your bank information online via a web browser, then you’ll be accessing the same databases and information through a mobile app. Plus, if anything goes wrong your money is protected at all reputable banks up to $250,000 by the FDIC.  We scoured the internet for customer reviews, both positive and negative, and carefully considered ratings in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. We only featured top-notch financial institutions that are FDIC insured and have a reputation for quality banking and customer service. For applicable institutions, we also relied on the 2021 J.D. Power U.S. Banking Mobile App Satisfaction Survey for more abundant data to help inform our analysis.1 J.D. Power. \"2021 U.S. Banking Mobile App Satisfaction Study.\" Accessed Aug. 21, 2021."

Mobile app development no longer requires you to learn complex programming languages. Knowledge of web-based languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is enough to build awesome-looking high performing native applications. If you are running on limited resources and time, there are some great cross-platform app development frameworks available that can help you build cross-platform mobile apps using a single codebase. Being a leading mobile app development company, we have collected and listed the top ten mobile app development frameworks of 2021. React Native is one of the most popular mobile app and best framework for web development. The JavaScript framework is used for cross-platform app development. It’s open source and allows you to build apps for Android and iOS platforms simultaneously. React Native is developed by Facebook and gaining a lot of traction in recent years. This is the best framework for mobile app development that significantly reduces the mobile application development time and helps you build reliable, powerful, and quality applications in less time. Moreover, as you can use the same code base for both Android and iOS, React Native helps save a lot of resources which can be further used in the promotion and up-gradation of the applications. Furthermore, it uses heavy javascript which makes moving from one project to another quite simpler for developers. You can even use the Live Reload feature to verify the effect of codes instantly. Here’re the examples of apps built with one of the best mobile app development frameworks, React Native:  Ionic is another popular open-source framework for developing cross-platform mobile applications using web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is the best mobile app development framework that has always shown great results. Talking about the latest version, it’s using minimal DOM for better performance efficiency. It provides mobile optimised components as well as native APIs using Cordova and Ionic Native. It has its own command line interface tool which makes mobile app development quite easier and faster. Here are the top Ionic app examples: Want to Validate Your App Idea? We have designed and developed successful on-demand apps. Flutter is the portable user interface framework and one of the most popular mobile app development frameworks that used for building beautiful, natively-compiled applications for mobile, desktop and web. It’s developed by the search giant Google who allows you to target a wide range of users with a single code base. As it’s yet to become popular in the market, the community support is less but more and more people have started using it in recent times. It’s free, open-source, and backed by Google. So, I don’t think there’s any reason to not try it out. We have also created an android tutorial using flutter animation that you can refer here, Check out top mobile applications that are developed on the Flutter framework: Xamarin is also among the popular open source names for developing cross-platform mobile applications. It was founded in 2011 and acquired by Microsoft in 2016 with an aim to make mobile app development simpler and easier. It comes with almost all the essential tools required to build apps with native features. Just like other mobile app development frameworks, the application shares the common codebase and thus reduces the development time and cost. Xamarin is available to download with Visual Studio. A large amount of code is already written in C#. Hence, there’s no need to learn Java, Objective-C, or Swift to build apps. If you already know C#, then going with Xamarin will help you make apps for more than one platforms in no time. Here’re the examples of top mobile apps built with Xamarin framework: PhoneGap is an open source cross-platform mobile app development framework that eradicates the use of complex languages such as Java for Android and Swift for iOS. It allows you to develop hybrid applications targeting all the devices by using web-based languages such as HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. PhoneGap was initially launched as ‘Apache Cordova’ introduced by Nitobi. But later Adobe purchased Nitobi and renamed Apache Cordova as ‘PhoneGap’. This is the best mobile app framework that strives to bridge the gap between hybrid and native apps of mobile devices. PhoneGap wraps up the progressive web apps with native mobile applications and enhances their functionality. The final application is wrapped within a platform native ‘WebView’ browser object, and ultimately becomes a stand-alone application. Here are the top PhoneGap app examples: The Intel XDK is a complete cross-platform development environment for hybrid mobile apps and web apps development. The main highlight of this environment is it enables the developer to cost-effectively create, test, debug, build and deploy HTML5-based hybrid apps at a very less cost. Apps were created using the IDE then exported to Adobe PhoneGap for compilation into a native code app. Targeting different platforms using the same code is not difficult but it’s not recommended to use Intel XDK for heavy feature-rich applications. Furthermore, It also supports the developing future-oriented Internet of Things and NodeJS apps that uses Intel maker board. As per the company’s policy, they don’t reveal the names of companies of users who use Intel XDK. So, there’s no information available about the apps built on this platform.

The scanner matches data on the barcode to that of the corresponding information in the database. Mostly, the barcode printed in products contains data including the manufacturing date, batch number, expiry date, and the price of the product. Table of Contents Barcode scanner software help in managing the inventory of businesses. Traditional barcode scanners scan 1D linear barcodes which appear as an image of parallel lines and spaces (known as quiet zones). The quiet zone is used to prevent the scanner from picking up information that isn’t required in the barcode scan.  For decades, 1D barcodes had been and are still being used to record data, despite them being limited to 20-25 characters. But today, several different barcode types are being used worldwide.  So how do barcodes work? It’s easier to consider them as a tech-savvy method of transmitting strings of alphanumeric characters. These characters can be compared to a vehicle’s license plate number, which can be used to fetch more details about the car and its owner.  Different barcode types have different volumes and dimensions, which makes them useful for particular sectors in various industries. Barcode technology is ever evolving. Today, one doesn’t even need a barcode scanning device to read barcodes. Your smartphone is capable of scanning most of the modern barcodes, with the help of a barcode scanner app.  Here are some barcodes types that are being used today: One of the first barcode types, Code 39, is usually implemented in the healthcare, electronics, and government sectors.   It is a type of 1D alphanumeric code in which all of the 128 ASCII characters can be included, and the code can be of any size or length.  It has been derived from the 128 ASCII character set and is specifically used by the shipping and packaging industries. It follows a setting that lets users customize the length of the barcode. Universal Product Codes are perhaps the most popular of all barcodes across the globe. Found in almost every product, these were initially created for accelerating the process of inventory tracking and receipt generation for grocery stores. Similar to UPC, EAN is used in the academic sector, especially by libraries, booksellers, and educational institutions to keep track of books. EAN codes are generated with the help of International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN) This linear 2D barcode is found in documents such as ID cards and drivers’ licenses because of its abilities such as encoding for multiple data sources in a single code. This can be elongated more than 2D barcodes such as QR Codes and Data Matrix. Data Matrix is one of the standard 2D barcode types today as its square-shaped codes can store large amounts of data in a small space. Data Matrix codes are quite popular in sectors such as healthcare and electronics.  QR Codes are the most trending barcodes today and are becoming more popular. QR codes are being used to read internet-based information, such as offers and online payments on their smartphones. With the help of a barcode scanning app, one can quickly scan almost all types of QR codes. They aren’t as compact as Data Matrix, but QR Codes are quite often used in product promotions and storefronts.    The reason why people are choosing barcode scanning apps is due to their multitude of features and benefits.

Power rating of 890 points out of 1,000 for its credit card mobile app.",
        "body": "At Experian, one of our priorities is consumer credit and finance education. This post may contain links and references to one or more of our partners, but we provide an objective view to help you make the best decisions. For more information, see our Editorial Policy. American Express takes the top spot for credit card mobile app satisfaction, according to the 2021 U.S. Credit Card Mobile App Satisfaction Study by J.D. Power. Here's how the top five credit card mobile apps ranked and why they're the best. American Express took the crown for the second year in a row and the third time in the past four years. In 2021, Amex received a J.D. Power rating of 890 points out of 1,000 for its credit card mobile app. The credit card mobile app makes it easy to switch between credit card accounts. Once you've picked a card, you can review your transactions, make payments and set up long-term payment plans. You can also review your rewards balance and redeem your points or cash back directly from the app. It also allows you to explore and activate various card benefits and Amex Offers, which give you additional rewards or statement credits when you make qualifying purchases with select retailers. American Express was also ranked No. 1 in J.D. Power's U.S. Online Credit Card Satisfaction Study, which means you'll get a top-notch experience whether you're on your mobile device or your desktop browser. If you're considering an Amex credit card, the Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express offers outsized rewards in certain categories. Foodies could get even more value from the American Express® Gold Card. Terms apply to all American Express offers. You may be matched with this and other cards at Experian CreditMatch™ Find Out If You're Matched It's important to note that while USAA's mobile app had a higher score than American Express', J.D. Power didn't rank it in the study because USAA restricts access to its products to eligible members of the military community and their families. Bank of America's mobile app was ranked second in the mobile app satisfaction study, with a rating of 880 points. The bank offers a wide range of alerts that you can set to help you not only track your expenses but also to help prevent fraud, keep an eye on rewards and BankAmeriDeals offers, and track your FICO® Score☉ . That way, you don't necessarily have to check your app often—just set up as many alerts as you want, and you'll be notified about the updates that are most important to you. With each card, you'll also be able to view your card benefits. If you have a card like the Bank of America® Premium Rewards credit card, which offers an annual $100 airline incidental fee credit, you may be able to see exactly how much of the benefit you have left for the year. Another card to consider if you want to take advantage of Bank of America's mobile features is the Bank of America® Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card, which offers a flat 1.5% cash back, with the chance to earn up to 2.62% back on everything if you're a qualifying Bank of America Preferred Rewards customer. Bank of America ranked third in the U.S. Online Credit Card Satisfaction Study behind Discover. The Discover mobile app, which ranked No. 1 in 2019 and 2017, came in third in 2021, with a rating of 875 points. The bank's mobile app makes it easy to switch between your accounts on the main page and also allows you to quickly check your FICO® Score from the dashboard. In addition to showing you your recent transactions, Discover also provides a spend analyzer, which breaks down your transactions into categories and also shows you monthly trends so you can better understand where your money is going. You can also view and redeem your cash back or miles (depending on which card you have), freeze your account and more. Discover ranked second in the U.S. Online Credit Card Satisfaction Study. Chase ranked No. 4 in the credit card mobile app study with a rating of 867 points, which is the average for the top 11 national card issuers. Chase lists all of your credit card and other financial accounts on the front page, making it easy to switch back and forth between them. You can easily track expenses, make payments and set alerts, as with most credit card mobile apps. You'll also be able to see your card benefits, and if you have a Chase credit card that earns Ultimate Rewards, you can explore ways to redeem your points from the Chase mobile app. If you've booked trips through the Ultimate Rewards platform, you'll also be able to view and manage your trips. You can also peruse and activate Chase offers to earn cash back with select merchants. While Chase is in the top five for its mobile app, the bank is ranked seventh for its online credit card satisfaction. Capital One ranked No. 5 in the study with a rating that's slightly below Chase and the industry average, with 866 points. Like the other credit card mobile apps on the list, you can manage your transactions, set alerts, view and redeem rewards, lock and unlock your card, activate cash back deals and access your credit score—though Capital One offers credit scores from VantageScore®, not FICO. One thing that sets the bank apart from the others is that you can also create virtual card numbers that are tied to your account but don't reveal your primary account number. You can use these numbers to shop online, then cancel them when you're done to help protect yourself from fraud. Capital One was ranked eighth in the online credit card satisfaction survey, so you may get a better experience on your mobile device than on your desktop browser. Find out more about the Capital One Mobile App to find out if it meets your needs. If you're a travel enthusiast, consider applying for the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card, which offers a solid one-time bonus for new cardholders and a flat 2 miles per dollar on every purchase. If you prefer cash back, the Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card offers a flat 1.5% cash back on every purchase. As you compare credit cards, it's important to look beyond the rewards and benefits, especially if you like to manage your finances on the go. As you look at mobile apps for each card you're considering, here are some helpful features to keep an eye out for: If you're considering switching to a new credit card, make sure you check your credit score before you apply. Most of the best cards require good or excellent credit, which means a score in the upper 600s or higher. If your credit score isn't where it needs to be, consider taking time to improve your credit before you start applying for new cards.

Either way, they all hold value in some way. Top 50 Websites to Learn Mobile App Development. The following list is broken down into three sections: Android Development and Resources",
        "body": "Code Conquest August 31, 2015 by Code Conquest Leave a Comment Welcome to our final installment of the Top 50 Series: The Top 50 Websites to Learn Mobile Development. Before diving into the list of 50 resources for learning mobile app development, you should be familiar with a few important statistics. Did you know that 1 in 5 people in the world own a smartphone? And 1 in 17 people in the world own a tablet. And both phones and tablets heavily rely on mobile apps. Furthermore, in the US alone there are 224 million monthly app users who are active at any given time. You get the point: mobile is hot, and it’s in high demand.  That’s exactly why it’s a great time to learn how to create mobile apps. Of course, the most difficult part will be pinpointing which mobile app platform to focus on. There is Apple and iOS, Google’s Android — across a whole slew of different devices — Windows Phone and even Blackberry. Android and iOS are the two obvious choices to pursue since they’re the most widely used. Whichever platform you choose, however, you’ll need to learn a different language. Luckily the fundamentals of programming largely remain the same no matter what you’re developing. However, before diving into mobile app development, having a handle on programming basics will help. Objective-C is the primary language for Apple devices like the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. (However, Swift is up and coming.) The official language for Android development, on the other hand, is Java. However, you can create mobile applications for Android through the Android Native Development Kit (NDK) using C and C++ but it’s not recommended or promoted by Google. Windows Phone apps are designed in multiple ways: XAML is used for the UI and C# or Visual Basic is used for the programming aspect. With the latest version, Windows Phone 8, you can develop applications with C++ using Direct3D to take advantage of powerful graphics hardware. The latter is relevant if you want to develop mobile games. We’re not going to explain Blackberry in depth because you can use a wide variety of languages with it. Moreover, the platform is no longer popular among mobile users. As far as choosing a platform, your best bet is to choose the one you intend to use most. If you don’t have a variety of test devices then stick with the platform that matches the current device you own. This will allow you to test and prototype your work on an existing mobile device. Unlike learning other programming languages, mobile app development takes more time and involves multiple layers. Nonetheless, it is very possible to teach yourself mobile app development.

        "body": "Even the most well-designed and innovative apps can go unnoticed among over 3 million app across app stores. Have you submitted your mobile app to app review sites yet? According to a recent Google-Ipsos survey, 52% of awareness for apps comes from friends, family and colleagues, essentially word of mouth marketing. After you’ve built your mobile app with a custom software development company, getting positive app reviews can help you get more downloads and better visibility. If you’re new to app development, you might want to check out how much does it cost to build an app and go through creating a mobile app prototype to kickstart the development. If you’re interested in an app builder, read our detailed guide. However, having app reviews on App Store is not enough. Getting your app reviewed on a popular app review sites, blogs, or publication works better. Favourable app reviews on one of these sites coupled with growth hacks can expose your app to a whole new audience and help you get more downloads. In this post we are giving you a list of 200+ resources covering top app review sites, blogs, YouTube channels, and even app discovery platforms to submit your app to. This app review sites list will allow you to submit your app details such as app description, landing page URL, funding information, founder details, sometimes a demo video, etc. to their website. If you want to make any updates on your app, hire developers today. After all, you never know where you’d discover your potential customer. However, just this app review sites list won’t help you get featured. Approach each one of them with the right pitch, giving proper details of your app. Also, don’t forget to test your app for crashes and bugs before submitting it on any app review sites. I am sure you are not interested in any kind of negative publicity or why take the chance of not getting published because of a faulty app.       If you’ve created a mobile app and you want to increase the number of users it has, it’s important to market your app properly. There are lots of stale and rote ways to market and app—but the apps that really stand out are the ones whose creators take unconventional and innovative approaches to marketing. Here are 5 ways you should consider marketing your app right now so you can attract the right audience and continue to grow its user base. A good way to get your app discovered is to have it featured in the Apple app store. To do that, use LinkedIn to reach out to app store managers. Once you’ve searched the professional networking site for their email addresses, send them a pitch explaining why you should be featured. Try to find the right app store manager (or managers)—you want to reach out to the ones who manage the category your app fits into, and you don’t want to reach out to too many people. One smart marketing move is to do a soft launch of your app in a country that speaks enough English to get it—but one that isn’t as big or as crucial as, say, the U.S. or Canada. Consider the Netherlands or the Phillipines, then do a launch of your app there. You can focus on generating word of mouth excitement about your creation, get reviews, then take any feedback to improve your app. You want to make sure it’s perfected—and has somewhat of a reputation—before you undertake a campaign to get featured in the U.S. app store. Reviews help you naturally market your game, because other app users want to see what real people think of an app before they decide to download and use it. Incentivize app reviews by gamifying them, or offering prizes for them. For example, you can offer users a bonus in the app if they leave you a review. Harness word of mouth marketing for an effective way to increase downloads. Stop focusing on marketing the game and market yourself. Build a presence for yourself on the web by getting active in social media, writing a blog, offering to guest blog, accepting guest blog offers on your blog, and more. By building your own social media presence, you can harness your own following and reputation to push the app you’ve created. Don’t just think about your app itself (or the marketing content you create), focus on the icon for the app. It’s the first thing a potential user sees and can make or break the first impression. If you want to up downloads, take a look at your icon and redesign if needed. Your icon’s UI design needs to be simple enough that it’s not confusing or overwhelming, but that it’s branded and unmistakably yours. Hire a specialized UI UX design agency to redesign your app icon."

        "desc": "Most top-tier apps feature a dedicated search function to allow users to locate content that contains the keywords and key phrases relevant to what they need. This helps keep the mobile app convenient and accessible. 2. Social Media Networking Capabilities. Social media sharing isn't just for quick cat videos and kids' pictures anymore.",
        "body": "Some business mobile application developments are extremely useful, practical, intuitive, and outright fun to use. Others are frustrating, boring, or are very nearly useless. What makes them different? What features and app design elements separate the proverbial wheat from the chaff when it comes to mobile applications? These features are essential for developing a mobile app that makes the grade with users. 1. Search Feature Shown in Mobile Application Give your mobile app users a handy search bar so that they can find the content they need quickly. Lots of content makes for great mobile app design, but all that content quickly becomes cumbersome and unusable if it isn’t made easily accessible to the mobile user. Most top-tier apps feature a dedicated search function to allow users to locate content that contains the keywords and key phrases relevant to what they need. This helps keep the mobile app convenient and accessible. 2. Social Media Networking Capabilities Social media sharing isn’t just for quick cat videos and kids’ pictures anymore. Social media apps has already made its mark when it comes to communicating and collaborating with other people you know online, especially among workers who are geographically separated and between workers and their customers. Make this easy and seamless by incorporating social sharing (as well as email sharing) directly from your mobile application. 3. Responsive Mobile App Design for Varying Screen Sizes Mobile app designing for Android and/or Apple devices is no longer enough. Most mobile app developers also need to consider the range of screen sizes between the small ‘compact’ and ‘mini’ phones and larger tablets. Some smartphones feature screens almost as big as a small tablet. The iPhone XS Max, for instance, features a 5.8″ screen, less than 1.5″ smaller than the smallest consumer-grade tablets. Make sure to incorporate responsive app design into your mobile app development so that all of these users receive a stellar design experience.  4. Different Versions for Different Mobile Devices Similarly, you can no longer neglect any of the popular platforms. While BlackBerry used to rule the business world and Apple held a solid grip on the consumer market, BlackBerry devices are now obsolete after realising too late that they needed to adopt Android operating systems in order to remain relevancy, and Android devices constantly compete with Apple in both the business and consumer markets. Still, Apple holds enough market shares that it can’t be ignored. Develop a mobile app product for each of these platforms so that you don’t alienate a large segment of your users off the bat with relevant UK mobile app development services. 5. Less Keyboarding and More Mobile Screen Touching When users are at a keyboard-mouse setup accessing your website services, you can ask them lots of information and they can type, type, type away. This isn’t the case with mobile app designs. Design the app for minimal use of the keyboard and make as much of the user experience as possible touch-based. 6. Allow for Compelling User Feedback Sometimes the user just needs to express something. Giving users the ability to provide instant feedback is gratifying and eliminates lots of calls to the tech support department.  Allowing users to give you feedback definitely gives you and your team of mobile app developers a helpful insight into what you need to add, eliminate, and change. But it does more than that. Giving the users the ability to provide immediate feedback lets them vent their frustrations (and with a working app, there are always frustrations), meaning your mobile agency tech support staff has to field fewer angry phone calls. Win-win. 7. The Ability to Work Offline Provide as much app usability as possible without an Internet connection. This feature has to be balanced, of course, with the issue of data protection and security. While you don’t want to have load lots of sensitive data on mobile devices that will spend lots of time on busy commuter trains and coffee shops, you do want to enable at least some work to be done if Internet access isn’t available. What and how much data and functionality is stored on the device depends on your specific mobile app requirements. As you can see, a lot goes into developing a super mobile app design that users adore. Most businesses determine that a professional developer is better suited to the job than their in-house mobile app development agencies.

If a mobile banking app makes you think of depositing checks and discovering your balance quickly, you’re in good company. These are classic tasks. Yet, it’s a bit like thinking about a smartphone for its ability to make calls — useful, sure. But there’s tons more to do than the basics, and these new and planned features can actually save you time and money. You may not know it yet, but a growing number of banks are upgrading their mobile apps to act like a personal financial assistant in your pocket or purse in all sorts of small ways — including by helping you sidestep the bank’s money maker: the overdraft fee. If these banks have their way, their mobile apps will become central to customers’ lives at a time when most of us need the day-to-day help. “Your bank should be doing a lot more to help with your financial health,” says Zachary Smith, head of product at Chime, a digital banking provider. As an industry, there’s a lot of work ahead. Not only do traditional banks make money off of fees, they struggle with their digital strategies, including the way you sign up for an account. But a number of bank apps are getting updated to help you make smart money moves at a time when financial institutions are worried about keeping us as customers as new threats mount. Ever-more of us prefer to bank online and our options for where to park our money are multiplying at firms known for shaking up the mobile banking experience. Moreover, we are asking for such features. According to a recent J.D. Power study, 58 percent of customers said they want the ability to receive advice and guidance from their bank’s mobile app or website. Here’s what you need to know about what you can get from a mobile bank app today, and what to expect next. One in three Americans said they wing their finances, according to a recent U.S. Bank survey. That’s problematic: About half of Americans don’t have enough money in their savings account to cover a $400 unexpected emergency. Banks know we’re in a precarious setup — institutions regularly ask for our feedback and they see our transaction data. They know where we spend our money, how much we make, what kind of bills we have and much more. They also know that they have an opportunity to supply us suggestions about what to do through their mobile apps. Consider U.S. Bank’s recently overhauled mobile app. The Minneapolis bank’s app now sends customers warnings and suggestions about their money. Not only will the bank app flag customers who are in danger of overdrafting their account before it happens, it will suggest when they can afford to put, say, $50 into a savings account. It will also notify them when their recurring payments have changed and if a merchant charges them twice for a single item and much more. “Customers really expect financial services firms to leverage what we know about them and anticipate their needs — so it helps them better manage their finances moving forward,” says Ankit Bhatt, senior vice president of omnichannel experience at U.S. Bank. The app, which started rolling out in late March, is currently only available on the iOS operating system, but the bank said it will launch an Android app this summer. The rollout highlights a rising trend in recent months. Huntington Bank launched digital banking features that predict what a customer can afford to spend, when a merchant mistakenly double charges your card and more. Bank of America’s virtual assistant, Erica, now flags customers when a recurring charge or membership fee increases. MX and Personetics — bank tech vendors — have teamed up to sell banks and credit unions across the country the means to spit out more digital financial advice. When banks don’t operate branches, they can pass on the operational savings to you — by eliminating a lot of fees that big banks typically charge. Chime, a popular neobank that partners with The Bancorp Bank to hold your deposits, is such an example—the digital bank account doesn’t charge customers monthly fees or overdraft fees. It’s found a large market among younger adults. Since its 2014 launch, Chime has opened about 3.5 million accounts and it continues to add hundreds of thousands of accounts per month. Beyond eliminating many typical bank fees, the Chime app comes with several features designed to improve your financial health. One intriguing feature lets customers get their paycheck two days earlier. “That’s a big deal because three-quarters of Americans live paycheck to paycheck and money runs tight a couple of days before payday,” Smith says. It’s a rare feature but there are others offering it, too. Varo Money is another digital-only account that lets customers access their paycheck early. It’s hard enough to find what you’re looking for in a junk drawer. But when what you’re looking for is invisible — which monthly subscriptions, yoga classes, money advice and whatever else has your payment card stored—good luck. Or, use a mobile bank app. Last year, Wells Fargo launched Control Tower, a hub located inside of your digital banking account. In it, you can keep track of your recurring payments to subscriptions, like the corner gym or meal kits, as well as some third-party apps. The longer-term vision is to let customers control which devices, apps and companies have access to their account information through Control Tower. What sounds simple is a big deal. Control Tower represents part of a huge trend invading digital banking: the ability to control your financial data on third-party apps through a bank app. Most of us lack emergency savings. To address this problem, mobile apps that move small amounts of money from our checking into our savings have been around for a while. Think Digit and Acorns. Now, a few banks are offering similar functionality — via a standalone app or via an option within a main banking app. For example, Fifth Third Bank acquired a fintech company so that it could relaunch an automated savings app this year. The Cincinnati bank’s free standalone app, Dobot, works for anybody with a checking account and is designed to get you in the habit of savings. Meanwhile, USAA, Chime and JPMorgan Chase offer customers automated savings capabilities in their main apps. Curious how you’re doing on your personal finances? Your bank app could help you. Some financial institutions, like KeyBank and USAA, spit out a score on customers’ overall financial health. This number is separate from a credit score and it is designed to help you measure and monitor how you’re doing across all of your finances, and potentially, motivate you to make progress. As banks continue to launch more features, you may not know where to find what you want — regardless of how intuitive the app is. So increasingly, banks are adding their equivalent of a Google search inside of their apps. BBVA Compass, for instance, lets mobile banking customers search for things via a bar within its app that asks “What you would like to do.” You can ask the navigation tool via your voice or a typed query, things like how to shut down a debit card or update your address. When you do, the app will take you to screen to complete your wish. With customers, the tool has been a hit. “We’ve seen the number of comments from customers saying that they can’t do this or that basically down to zero,” says Alex Carriles, executive director of online and mobile banking and digital accounts at BBVA Compass. U.S. Bank also improved the way it helps customers answer their questions on its new mobile app. Now, the app can guide the user step by step in the context of what they want to do. “Not only are we helping you in the context of what you’re looking for but we’re also, at the same time, educating the customer,” Bhatt says. Expect your mobile banking app to only get better at helping you handle your money as partnerships with fintech companies are made and mobile releases continue to regularly drop. Carriles envisions a day where you schedule your cable bill payment for tomorrow, but the bank’s technology detects that your payment would bounce. So, it sends you an alert to ask if you would like to schedule the payment for Monday instead — after your paycheck hits. “That way the bank really feels like it’s now on my court,” Carriles says. “It’s really helping me out.” Bankrate.com is an independent, advertising-supported publisher and comparison service.

        "body": "Share SHARE Select from the best app development companies for your next project. Compare app development companies by budget needs and choose the right development company for your business. When you look for the best app development company, you are really looking for the right development services for you, your business, and the apps you want to create. For instance, a mobile development game app company won’t necessarily be the best fit for a major accounting company with new software design. Or a smartphone app that must function and interact with your core software application will have different requirements, specs, and development solutions than a stand-alone web app. Mobile development is a lengthy complex process that you want to get right the first time. Each step, from requirements gathering, defining, researching, and wireframing to the final touches of UI/UX, Q&A testing, launch, and addressing any issues. Every step matters in product development and the development process. As such, you want the best app development company your budget can afford. A mobile app is must-have digital solution that the modern consumer expects. Finding the best iOS and Android mobile app developers will depend on your business needs, the complexity of your app and how it connects to your core software product. You’ll want the best technology united with your company vision and design. Digital solutions are key, but don’t always come ready out of the box. It will take custom development, transferring your web interface over to new mobile designs and then creating iOS, Android, and cross-platform versions that fit your product. Our team has created a list of the top app development companies in the world by budget needs. You’ll need to reach out to the companies yourself to determine pricing and timelines, but with the hundreds of mobile app development companies online, we wanted to give you a few places to start your search.

This tier is for companies that want top software solutions with the most skilled experts with years of experience that perform at a high level.

Rather than a single web development firm, Toptal carefully evaluates and selects the best mobile app developers and mobile app designers from across the globe. They match you with the best candidates for your particular business and mobile application. The company will guide you through the best fit.

Gigster bills itself as a freelance technology solution, but as far as customer-facing interactions, Gigster functions like a software development firm or mobile app development agency. Where Gigster stands out is their model for hiring top mobile app developers and tech talent, including IT services, front-end, or UI design. They focus on hiring freelancers that have worked at top companies like Google or attended top schools like MIT.

Even if you have a small budget for your new app, there are some options for you. Here are the best mobile app development companies in a low price range. Upwork is a freelance marketplace where you can hire any sort of freelancer, including mobile app developers and software developers. Technology developers are located around the world, and you may find whole Apple, Android, and cross-platform mobile app development companies rather than just freelancers. They even have wearables contractors! You can post your project needs and budget, and freelancers that come in near your budget will bid on the opportunity to fill the project needs. It will be your responsibility to establish the milestones and method of evaluation for payment. Due to cost of living and skill differences, there are freelancers that can meet just about any budget. Read the reviews to find the best digital solutions for your projects. Thousands of major companies around the world have used Upwork, although not necessarily for building mobile app solutions. When it comes to hiring internationally, Upwork provides some level of assurance. They have an established payment platform that holds payments in escrow. Keeping a deposit in escrow means mobile developers don’t have to worry about whether they’ll get paid, and you don’t have to worry about the software developers running off with an upfront deposit. Additionally, all bank and currency conversion fees and issues are handled for you. The downside is that they take out a significant portion of the payment, but that may be worth the assurances you receive. Short on money? Appy Pie is a DIY option for building an iOS or Android app. Build your own app using their drag and drop features, or get a quote for having them build it for you. To do it yourself, the platform has dozens of app categories and features that let you build out your technology without a line of code. They’d like to think it's as easy as...well Appy Pie. Subscriptions cost anything from free to $40/month. The level of subscription determines how customized the app is to your business and what marketplaces the app can be launched in. Appy is a popular app building company. Appy has been used by customers like Nike, Home Depot, Accenture, and Southwest. Their business is a great way to cheaply demo an app as you complete user research. The platform has received lots of press reviews, from Forbes to Inc. to Mashable. Trustpilot gives the site five stars, and Capterra awarded the platform with Best Ease of Use and Best Value badges. The site has been used to build over five million mobile apps. AppMachine is another DIY mobile app company that allows you to build an app in a matter of hours. With AppMachine, you can convert your website content directly to your app for brand coherence and just some time-saving. The software platform uses drag and drop building blocks for your design, but also allows you to change your design down to the pixel, so you can make app just the way you want. Begin paying only when you publish. This model lets you take your time designing, testing, and just generally playing. AppMachine has a more user-friendly interface than many DIY app companies, perhaps due to its longer history in the business. In 2013, TheNextWeb reviewed AppMachine calling it “the most powerful ‘create your own mobile app’ product we’ve seen.” However, there is not an option to have someone from AppMachine build the app for you, but AppMachine may be used by top mobile app companies. The platform also appears to be structured to allow mobile developers to design apps for clients and then pass the technology on to clients, so you still may be able to hire someone to build the app on AppMachine for you. OpenXcell is an affordable way to get your mobile app custom-developed well. They openly share that they outsource much of the software development work so that it can be done more affordably. They can work with your budget to ensure you can still make your iOS or Android app happen, though a lower technology budget may require more time. That said, they still manage to deliver quality products. While OpenXcell has received a couple marks off for quality, they compensate with their quick response time and great customer service. Working with OpenXcell is probably the most affordable way to reliably get a custom app completed. OpenXcell has worked with some top companies including Orderhive, Pedigree, University of Florida, and Driscoll’s (the berry company). Many of their clients are startups due to the cost structure. You can take a look at their portfolio of app solutions on their website. Levogy’s mission is to leverage technology and empower businesses in the digital-first world.

You can change this any time. Learn more Sometimes there is a need for an app and no budget for custom development in a mobile app development company. Many small businesses and individual experts still need apps to promote their services. If the purpose is not to create an enterprise but simply introduce a new idea on the local market, free no-code mobile app development platforms come in handy. Quick and quite simple, these solutions allow the users with no or little coding experience to make their own apps from scratch. Creating apps is becoming more accessible than ever, but is it as good as it seems? Is such software a real competitor for native app development professionals? Let’s find out. Many platforms for mobile app development help users with no coding experience create an app. It is as simple as making a poster in Canva or a website in Tilda. Such software is aimed at beginners who have no idea about programming languages: they usually have simple, intuitive designs and are constructor-like: you don’t see the insides of the app, only its future design and functions. Most of such platforms offer drag-and-drop solutions: you can select the preferable option and move it to the app’s interface. Some say that the future is in the app development software for beginners: small businesses are not willing to spend a lot of money on their apps. Often, they don’t have such budgets. Let’s take a look at some of the best free mobile app development platforms and explore their advantages. In this guide, we list some options for those who don’t have any coding experience but still would like to create an app themselves. The first advantage of all of them is quite clear: they are free. Custom app development costs money. Even many mobile app development solutions require a subscription fee or a single-use license. The following platforms can help those who cannot invest in app development and are looking for simple enough solutions.  Swing2App is a Korean software for mobile app development. This mobile application platform does not require any specific programming knowledge and has a simple and intuitive constructor-like interface. There are six app prototypes and many features to add. The platform allows editing the app and adding content in real-time, without updating. Users can easily create, test, and fix bugs. There is a free plan for both private and commercial use. The free version of the platform allows adding your apps to Play Market and has limited storage space: 100 MB. One of the most significant advantages of Swing2App is not only its simplicity in use but also safety. They work with Amazon Web Services to provide daily backups and keep the data safe. It is one of the most popular app-building platforms available.  Similarly to Swing2App, MobinCube is a DIY app development platform for beginners that does not require any coding knowledge. This solution offers a simple visual interface for choosing app design and functions. MobinCube has around 30 templates to use that can be easily customized. You can make your app from scratch as well. The users can post their apps on Google Play, Amazon, and other platforms with no download limit, which is a great advantage. Many features can be integrated into an app, such as Google Maps, databases, audio and video, and Google Analytics. What is more, you can even add push notifications to your app, which is so important for working with clients!  Composer Pro by AppGyver is free for small businesses and individual use. AppGyver introduces itself as a world’s first professional no-code app building platform. Composer Pro creates optimized React Native apps, providing access to all native iOS and Android features. The service offers common for such platforms drag-and-drop visual interface. There are more than 500 UI elements to choose from. The platform features the logic canvas, where you can drag-and-drop the app functions, as well as database integration and management options. The users can also preview the app in real-time on any device. DHL is using an app entirely created in Composer Pro for trailer fleet management.  AppsMoment is a Ukrainian app building platform with a standard drag-and-drop interface. It allows creating one free app. The creators provide ready-made templates to use and more than 150 features. It is possible to develop games using the platform with over 100 game templates. This platform offers quite various app features, such as QR codes, push notifications, monetization from ads, and others.  Siberian is a French open-source app builder. It offers one app for free. It is a drag-and-drop platform that provides some customizable templates. You have to download and install the builder on your device to start creating your own app. It is the main downside: not everyone is tech-savvy enough to get through the process as you have to know how Web hosting works. Still, there are tutorials available, as well as online support. Siberian is targeted at small businesses, and their templates and features reflect it: you can add bookings, calendar, payments, forms, and many other options. The platform lets the user keep the app’s entire source code, meaning total ownership over it. We already mentioned that the main advantage of the listed apps is the fact that they are free. But does it mean that you can get a quality product without investing a single dollar? Unfortunately, no. First of all, you can have a fully ready app, but it is not possible to simply add it to any app store with one click. It is essential to remember that even with the free app-making tools, you have to pay a fee to Google Play or Apple App Store to get your app listed. You have to pay a one-time fee of $25 to become Google Publisher and a $99 fee for an annual Apple Developer account. Secondly, you should be ready to read all the guidelines to make your app suitable for publishing. Both Google Play and the App Store have a list of requirements the app has to follow. Publishing an app might be more challenging than making it. Secondly, most of the free app building platforms offer apps with rather limited functionality. Often, there are download or storage use limits. There is a certain number of possible designs and functions, and you can’t step above them. Not all your creative ideas can be fulfilled with such websites’ help – they offer a compromise between your needs and their capacities. Finally, quality is the biggest question. You are the only person to create, test, and launch the app. The app looks good, but most often, one can tell that it is not a custom product. Template-made apps can be beneficial for small enterprises and initiatives, but they can make your brand look less reliable. What is more, there might be many app functionality issues, which can result in you spending more and more time making the app work properly. Creating an app has become manageable, even for those who have never coded in their lives. You don’t have to hire a highly qualified specialist to get an app for your small business or new idea. But what do we end up with: are template-made apps the same quality as custom-made ones? The answer is, of course, no. Sure, such platforms are useful options and can definitely help those who are only starting out and don’t have a budget or time to spend on application development. These platforms might be convenient for small businesses, such as local shops, cafés, B&Bs, beauty salons, etc. Individual experts, like personal trainers or tutors, might use no-code app building websites to promote their services on the local level. More and more people are now creating apps for their events, for example, weddings, to provide guests with all the necessary information. App-builders are a good pick for those instances. If we are talking about a bigger business that enters a highly competitive market or tries reaching customers outside their small community, app-builders might not be the best choice. It is a perfect temporary measure to see if the app is needed and how people interact with it. After some time, you can invest in a more professional-looking and better functioning app. Constructor-like software provides constructor-like solutions, meaning that your customers can tell that the app is not custom-made. Apps created using app-building platforms often have issues with properly supporting such features as push notifications or sensors. They tend to be quite simple and any deviation from the template might cause problems. It is crucial to look professional if you want your customers to trust you: details form the brand image. In this case, it makes sense to hire a professional team to develop a mobile application. With no design or functionality limitations, you can get an app that will serve your business purposes. At Redwerk, our app development team will be happy to assist you in creating your perfect app!

        "body": "There was a time when collecting data on the go involved a lot of preparation, manual tasks, and sprints to places with a stable internet connection when you were in a pinch. But that is changing as remote work becomes more common and people have access to the internet in more places. Consider the 2017 Samsung-commissioned study that surveyed 1,205 people who spent at least a third of their day working remotely, worked at companies with at least 100 employees, and had to own a smartphone. The study yielded a number of eyebrow-raising findings across six groups of jobs, including site workers, field service workers, drivers, public safety workers, and healthcare workers:  Start using Jotform Mobile Forms app for free to collect data on the go. Software companies have noticed and are responding by releasing new apps every year that give mobile phones the same capabilities as traditional computers, if not more. That means remote workers can access the same products, features, and services, regardless of whether they’re working in an office or conducting fieldwork. Offline features in mobile apps have even made it easy for people to access, view, collect, and share information anywhere, even if they can’t access the internet. With so many options out there, how do you decide which one to use? We’ll take the guesswork out of finding the right mobile data collection app. Cost: Free Availability: Google Play store and App Store Jotform, long known as the easiest online form builder, is making a big splash by changing the conversation around mobile forms. The form builder’s newest app, Jotform Mobile Forms, allows users to build, view, access, sort, fill out, share, and organize all data in a single place. This eliminates the need to use several siloed solutions in order to gather information, share it, and get work done. Jotform users can even download a PDF copy of submitted form information and add form respondents as contacts in their phone. The mobile app contains form fields that let people scan a QR code, provide their geolocation information, record a voice message, and add their electronic signature as they fill out a form. With this information, Jotform users can not only collect more specific data but also make decisions on the fly. The app also has an offline feature that allows users to collect the information they need when there’s limited or no connection to the internet. All the information collected offline is saved and synced to a Jotform user’s account once a stable Wi-Fi or wireless data connection is available. That means Jotform users can stop searching for a Wi-Fi connection and worrying about losing data that’s submitted when there’s no internet available. The handy kiosk mode feature allows app users to turn their mobile device into a public survey station. Kiosk mode pulls up a form, locks it in full screen so no other applications are visible, and refreshes a form after each submission. This, in turn, creates an uninterrupted experience so different people can fill out the same form at trade shows or conventions, for instance. Jotform users can even assign forms to team members who don’t have an account but need to access a form securely, fill it out, open it in kiosk mode, and manage their submitted information. After you provide a teammate’s name and email address, Jotform will send that person an email with instructions to access the form. While your teammates fill out the form, you can receive notifications about incoming submissions, view the data, and act quickly on the information you receive.  Jotform Mobile Forms also makes it easy for users to share forms or individual submissions. They can send forms via text message, in an email, and through social media channels, such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter. Jotform users with a starter, or free, plan can create up to five forms with an unlimited number of questions and receive up to 100 submissions each month. They also get up to 100 MB of space for uploaded files and can store up to 500 submissions in their account at any given time. Cost: Paid subscription required after free 30-day trial  Availability: Google Play store and App Store Smartsheet counts more than 75 percent of Fortune 500 companies as users and estimates that more than 15,000 new projects and processes are created on the interactive project management platform each day. The broad suite of features includes data visualization tools, centralized work portals, dashboard reports, work tracking boards, and automated request or approval workflows. Smartsheet also has a mobile app, available in eight languages, that allows registered users and team members to collaborate by accessing, viewing, editing, or updating sheets from their mobile device. Users can also sort information, respond to update requests, view project timelines, make decisions on relayed approvals, and pull up reports on key metrics that are updated in real time. The mobile app allows users and licensed collaborators to access and fill out a form attached to a sheet. Form responders can even scan a barcode, share location information, or upload files, including photos taken from their mobile device. Once a form is submitted, this information is used to populate rows in an associated sheet. According to Smartsheet, collecting data with forms is particularly helpful for employees, such as field inspectors, who travel or work from a number of sites and need to access information.  A paid subscription is required to use Smartsheet’s features and its mobile app after a free 30-day trial period. Once the trial period is over, any content created during that time can be viewed for 90 days. This data will be deleted if you don’t sign up for a subscription during the 90-day window. Smartsheet forms must be built on a desktop before they can be shared with licensed collaborators or sent in a link. Cost: Free Availability: Google Play store and App Store Device Magic helps workers collect and share information on the go. To get started, Device Magic users build forms on their laptops or desktops. A drag-and-drop tool allows them to select questions from a toolbar, place them on a blank workspace, and rearrange the order of questions. Team members added to a company’s Device Magic account can access forms through the app on their mobile devices. Permissions settings give users the flexibility to determine which devices or fellow users can access a form. Users can add devices to a Device Magic account by sending a text or email invitation to new team members. Device Magic also has offline capabilities, so users don’t need an internet connection to access, fill out, and submit forms through the app. In these cases, submitted form information is saved on a mobile device and transmitted once an internet connection has been reestablished. There are several advanced form fields, or questions, that allow team members to collect an electronic signature, scan a barcode, attach files, include a photo, and submit annotations to an uploaded image. Enterprise users can even use Device Magic’s Dispatch feature to have designated team members complete forms with prepopulated information or send a completed form to specific people once it has been submitted. This workflow can come in handy when remote workers need to share important information — such as job quotes, invoices, purchase orders, or inspection reports — and quickly get approval from managers. Device Magic offers a 14-day free trial of its Enterprise plan, after which users can sign up for a paid plan to access many key features. Users who do not upgrade after the trial period will be downgraded to a free account. There are no limits on the number of forms users with free accounts can create or the number of submissions they can receive. However, they can only connect one device per account, which means that they cannot assign or share forms across devices until they upgrade to a paid plan. Cost: Free Availability: Google Play store and App Store With Zoho Forms, registered users can build customizable forms, collect a broad range of information across devices, and manage where that data goes and how it’s used. That same range of functionality extends to the Zoho Forms app, which allows registered users to build forms from scratch or get a jumpstart on the process by using dozens of templates. Themes used to design a form, however, don’t appear in the app, and users must have a paid plan to customize the design of their form. The form builder offers a wide range of form fields and many types of questions, so users have more control over what data they collect and how they ask for that information. The electronic signature field, for example, allows people to sign a form on any device with a finger, stylus, trackpad, or mouse. Users can also modify the properties of individual questions, so they can determine how information is gathered and how questions will appear on a form. For instance, users can enable form respondents to scan barcodes, QR codes, and business cards with the camera on their mobile device. That data is then used to fill in specific information on a form, such as names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, product tags, or offer codes. As another example, activating the app’s geolocation feature for a specific form allows users to determine where someone filled out and submitted information. The Zoho Forms app allows users to publish their form on a website, share it on social media, or distribute it as a QR code or public URL. Forms, as well as any submitted form information, can be shared as tasks with other coworkers on the Zoho Forms account. The kiosk mode feature allows a form to be displayed in full-screen view within the Zoho Forms app. Multiple people can fill out a form on the mobile device but can’t access other parts of the app, such as submitted information or other forms. Users just set a passcode to ensure form respondents don’t gain full access to the app, and then use that passcode to close kiosk mode. The app allows users to append comments to forms for additional follow-up or background information. The Zoho Forms app also works offline, so users don’t need an internet connection to build forms, fill them out, and submit information. The data is saved and will be transmitted or uploaded once a mobile device is reconnected to the internet. Users on free plans can create up to three forms, receive up to 500 submissions a month, upload up to 200 MB of files, and collect up to 10 payments through their forms using Zoho’s integrations with payment processors, including Stripe and PayPal. With a basic plan, at $8 per month, users may receive up to 10,000 submissions each month and store up to 500 MB of files. Cost: Paid subscription required after free 14-day trial  Availability: Google Play store and App Store Spatial Networks, which leverages geospatial data to develop innovative solutions, launched Fulcrum for companies that rely on field-workers to collect and share information. More than 110,000 users in 180 countries have used the data collection tool to collect upwards of 174 million records and add more than 55 million geotags to uploaded photos. Fulcrum users must build a form on their desktop or laptop. They can either use a form builder to drag and drop the questions that they want to ask onto a blank space or select from a variety of templates by industry, such as agriculture, archaeology, business services, construction, environmental services, and emergency management. After a form has been created, it’s synced automatically to a user’s account and the Fulcrum app. Forms can be assigned to designated team members who can then fill in information, upload photos, capture electronic signatures, and scan barcodes or QR codes. Form respondents can also share geotagged photos with annotations, videos, and audio files that can be viewed on a mobile device, desktop, or laptop. Because these uploaded files contain geographic and location data, users can track this information on different types of maps offered by Fulcrum or other offline sources, such as Google Street or OpenStreetMap. Fulcrum’s offline capabilities allow users to view forms, fill them out, and submit information even when a stable internet connection isn’t available. The data is stored on a form respondent’s mobile device and transmitted once a cell phone signal or Wi-Fi connection is found. During the 14-day free trial of Fulcrum’s services and app, businesses can add up to 50 users to a single plan, export up to 100 records, create no more than three public URLs to share data, and store up to 3 GB of media files. Once the trial period is over, users can choose to upgrade to a paid plan, starting at $28 per user/month, or $22 per user/month when billed annually. Cost: Free Availability: Google Play store and App Store Magpi’s mobile app, Magpi+, seeks to help nonprofits and nongovernmental organizations lower data collection costs that were traditionally spent on programmers and tech consultants. Magpi users include well-known nonprofits, heath organizations, and academic institutions, including UNICEF, Mercy Corps, the World Bank, and The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Before forms can be deployed on mobile devices, Magpi users must build them on a web browser from their desktop or laptop. After logging into their Magpi account, users select the form fields that they’d like to use before formatting them and writing the desired text for all questions. Users must have a paid plan to allow form responders to scan barcodes and QR codes, or draw their electronic signature or a sketch. Magpi also allows users to create and fill out forms using a wide variety of languages and alphabets as long as their computers are configured properly and can read the information. Once Magpi users create their forms, they can assign them to team members who have access to the account and the Magpi+ app downloaded on their mobile devices. The app not only lets these team members access, fill out, and submit forms but also allows them to view submitted information as an ordered list, thumbnails based on shared images, or a map based on any geolocation data provided. Since any submitted form information is updated automatically in Magpi, teams can access this data regardless of whether they’re using a laptop, desktop, or mobile device to access their account. Since Magpi was developed for field-workers, the Magpi+ app has offline capabilities that allow teams to collect and submit information in areas that have little or no access to the internet. In these cases, submitted form information is saved on a device and transmitted once a stable internet connection is established. Magpi users with a free plan can create up to 20 forms, include up to 100 questions on a form, receive up to 500 submissions a month, and add up to 15 people to an account. Jotform Mobile Forms stands out in the crowd as an all-in-one, end-to-end solution. For starters, Jotform Mobile Forms allows you to build customized forms on your mobile device while you’re connected to the internet and need to work on the go. You can also give your forms a professional and polished touch on your smartphone or tablet. This means you no longer have to fret over siloed solutions that require you to build a form on your desktop or laptop before accessing it on a mobile device. Assigning forms to teammates and tracking their actions can be frustrating in many mobile data collection apps because you must either add them to your account or upgrade from a free plan. With Jotform Mobile Forms, you can assign forms to colleagues who don’t have a Jotform account, even if you have a free, starter plan. Some software companies will let you test out a mobile data collection app for a while but require you to buy a subscription once your trial period is over. Jotform Mobile Forms, however, is free to use for anyone who has a Jotform account, even if you have a free, starter plan. There isn’t even a limit on the mobile features that you can use for free, including the option to scan QR codes or collect electronic signatures. There’s no strings attached or fine print to read, so what you see is what you get. So, what are you waiting for? Give Jotform Mobile Forms a try today and see how the mobile data collection app is redefining the way people think about forms. Introducing Jotform Mobile Forms Offline forms: How to get work done on the go How mobile forms keep an outdoor adventure group in the loop How a fraternity manages data while on the go with a forms app Webinar: Everything you need to know about Jotform Mobile Forms How special mobile form fields can capture the data you need 10 mobile form design best practices Use Jotform Mobile Forms to assign forms with ease What is geolocation and how to integrate it into mobile forms Introducing touchless kiosk for mobile forms How to use Jotform Mobile Forms to customize form notifications What’s mobile invoicing, and what’s so great about it? The best Fulcrum app alternatives What is kiosk mode, and how can you use it to collect data remotely? How to write a safety inspection report  Hi Thanks for the article. Just thought I should mention NestForms. The NestForms.com platform is a mobile survey app as opposed to an online form builder. Forms are easily created by a central administrator and shared to responders who are working on the ground. Different components such as single, drop down and multiple answer menus are simply dragged and dropped into your form. You can add images, include GPS coordinates, QR and barcode scanning and much more. They provide great online and email support. As an individual who has been working in field service management industry for 25 years now, I cannot even come close to explain how mobile forms made our jobs much easier. I am working in a large cable supplier and we are always on the move, going to shops and homes to install phone lines. Living in Los Angeles the traffic was killing me to go to the place that required cable services and come back to our headquarters after every visit to report. If there was an oversight, I had to drive all the way back to the customer's house once more. It was a back and forth nightmare. 3 months ago, we have tried out Jotform mobile forms and thanks to that now I can report back immediately after a job is done, even can take photos of the cable work. Now instead of reporting back to our main office after every customer, I can just finish my daily round of customers and happily go back to the main office just once at the end of the day to check out. I had my doubts about the mobile app at first, thinking that it can never fully replace our current system. But, boy, that app proved me wrong. I can even collect signatures through the iPad! Thanks to the team who is behind this great app!  Thanks for verification! Jotform Blog Newsletter © 2021 Jotform Inc."

        "desc": "Cross-platform mobile development tools - on the other hand - make it possible to create a generic app for multiple platforms simultaneously, greatly cutting the costs and time needed to create an app, but this comes with a trade-off.

        "body": "A growing amount of companies are starting to realise that by attuning to their customer’s needs, they can grasp more opportunities for their own gain. One of these opportunities is the demand for mobile access to information regarding your company, be it regular company details or entire webshops; a trend which has brought many mobile development tools to the market.  Post updated: April 2021  According to Gartner, “by 2020, more than 75% of enterprises will have adopted at least one mobile application development platform to accelerate their digital (and therefore mobile) business transformation strategy.” With this uprising of devices such as mobile phones, tablets, and wearables such as smartwatches, many companies have started to develop mobile apps in order to increase the ease of access to their information and/or services for their customers. And how exactly do they accomplish this? With Mobile Development Tools.   Mobile Development Tools are software designed to assist in the creation of mobile applications. This can be accomplished in multiple ways, for example, there are native mobile development tools, but also cross-platform mobile development tools. *It may seem like a choice between quality or costs, so it’s best to have it all out on the table in terms of which tools you have to choose from.  Source: Business of Apps In this article we will provide you with an overview on the best 20 Mobile Development Tools that are available on the market. A guide to in-app feedback for mobile product owners and mobile marketers. Developers can choose between different approaches to cross-platform app development, including hybrid mobile app development and rapid mobile app development (RMAD), or ‘codeless’ mobile app development. Low-code or no-code tools may appeal to organisations that don’t have the in-house knowledge and/or can’t afford to hire developers; however, the setback with these options is that they don’t allow for as much control or customisation. In order to keep an oversight on the many platforms, the tools in this article will be separated into two categories: Let’s get started.  A native development tool is a software which allows developers to create applications for use in a single particular system family, platform or device, like Android, iOS, or Windows (note: support for Windows Mobile ends in December 2019). A native app is specially made and coded for a specific mobile platform in its native programming language, these being: There are different guidelines for each of these platforms and developers need to stick to them as they differ in typography, graphic styles, gestures, visual effects, data entry and more. Let’s start with the first native mobile development tool:  Xcode introduces a new way to design and build software. Swift is an innovative new programming language for Cocoa and Cocoa Touch and, when combined with Xcode tools, makes programming a delightfully live experience. Live rendering within Interface Builder displays your hand-written UI code within the design canvas, instantly reflecting changes you type in code. Xcode includes everything developers need to create applications for Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and Apple Watch. Xcode provides developers a unified workflow for user interface design, coding, testing, and debugging. Starting Price: Free Demo Available: No Free Trial: No Website: www.developer.apple.com/xcode  Android Studio is an Android development Software built by Google. Its implementation editor is very useful for Android developers. Android studio provides shortcuts for coding and designing and its layout designer makes it very easy to use, which helps reduce time spent on coding. Android studio also provides drag and drop features to design the layout of your projects. Starting Price: Free Demo Available: No Free Trial: No Website: www.developer.android.com/studio  AppCode is an IDE for iOS/macOS development. In addition to working with Objective-C, Swift and C/C++ programming languages, it supports web technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, XML, CSS, and more. It provides a variety of valuable integrations including among others CocoaPods manager and built-in Reveal support. In addition to the benefits AppCode provides to developers (such as saving their time on automating routine tasks, locating and fixing errors, taking advantage of intelligent support from the IDE, and increasing their overall productivity), it can be an equally valuable asset for your business. Starting Price: €8,90 per month Demo Available: No Free Trial: Yes, 30 days Website: www.jetbrains.com/objc With cross-platform mobile development, programmers on one platform can develop apps for one or more other platforms or mobile operating systems simultaneously. This can also enable developers to essentially use the same code base for different platforms. Meaning that such generic apps can be published and used on both an Android Phone and an iPhone. This greatly reduces the time and costs needed for creating an application, however; there are also down sides. Due to it being one and the same code base, these generic apps tend to have more platform-specific issues and a lower quality (user-interface, performance) than a native application. This of course varies per application, system and platform used. Furthermore, this category has also been split into three platforms: Coding platforms provide you with full control over your entire development process. The downside is that it requires knowledge over your chosen coding language. But this trade-off is undoubtedly worth it if you can streamline your app to perfection and have perfect control over your application.  Appcelerator is a mobile development tool which speeds up time to market with cross-platform development and testing and simplified access to date via optimised APIs. Real-time mobile analytics are available on the platform, helping to power user engagement and measure results. Appcelerator uses a single JavaScript code base for rich native mobile apps and cloud-connected mobile apps.

Additionally, the platform provides access to on-demand content from Xamarin’s university curriculum and monthly Azure credit. Starting Price: $25 per month Demo Available: No Free Trial: Yes Website: www.visualstudio.microsoft.com/xamarin  Adobe PhoneGap allows you to work with one code base, but with a different set of technologies. PhoneGap is an open source, cross-platform tool that builds apps with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web APIs. A PhoneGap application is essentially a collection of HTML pages wrapped in a native app shell, which are then pushed out to native platforms via native APIs. With PhoneGap, developers create files in HTML, CSS and JavaScript—much like they would when creating a website. These files are stored in a local directory or in the cloud, then when they’re run on a device, they access device features through plugins. This makes PhoneGap apps lighter-weight and highly reusable, but they have less of a native feel, and the quality of the UI is going to depend more on the Web View engine of the operating system rendering it. Note: Adobe PhoneGap is based on Cordova technology. In fact, If you are developing a hybrid mobile app, you can either create it using proper Cordova or choose Adobe’s ecosystem for using PhoneGap distribution of Cordova. Starting Price: Free Demo Available: No Free Trial: Yes Website: www.build.phonegap.com  Ionic is an easy-to-use, and easy-to-learn framework that allows for quick prototyping with a decent CLI.

React Native allows mobile app developers to build high-performance apps in shorter build cycles with faster deployment times, it is a budget-friendly option.",
        "body": "With more than 4 billion mobile users today if you aren't on connecting with your audiences on mobile, you don't exist. People enjoy using smartphones so much that it's come to needing to challenge ourselves to have a no-tech day. Checking your time, emails, booking a cab, shopping, ordering medicine, getting a legal consultation. Anything you want people to use in 2021, has to be built mobile first. Keeping this goal in mind, hybrid mobile development frameworks were built to roll-out mobile apps faster across multiple platforms by significantly reducing their development time. React Native is a very popular framework which builds for both Android or iOS apps. React Native allows mobile app developers to build high-performance apps in shorter build cycles with faster deployment times, it is a budget-friendly option. One of the major advantages of React Native framework is that it lets you develop truly native apps but doesn't compromise on user experience (UX) React Native provides a core set of platform-agnostic native components like Views, Text, Images all mapped to a platform’s native UI building block. It supports JavaScript which is a must for the full stack. Facebook owns React and that means a large pool of developers in an active online community that never stops optimising & debugging. Source Some famous apps built with React Native: Flutter is backed by Google so it inherits its UI toolkit for building beautiful native applications for mobile & desktop apps from a single codebase. It provides a wide array of customizable widgets to build native interfaces within minutes. Flutter gives a native experience to both the engineer & end user with commendable platform features such as scrolling, navigation, icons, plus fonts. Its built-in material design widget so you can easily create powerful, expressive UI for your applications. Source: Source Some famous apps built with React Native: Xamarin is a Microsoft owned open-source platform for building hybrid mobile apps using .NET and C#. Xamarin extends the .NET dev platform with tools + libraries for building apps for Android, iOS, tvOS, watchOS, macOS, and Windows. Being a Microsoft product, it has more than 60000 developers & contributors along with good customer support and extensive documentation. With an excellent native user interface, you can build natively while providing an amazing user experience. Source Some famous apps built with React Native: Ionic is an open-source, cross-platform mobile UI toolkit for native Android, iOS and web apps. The main advantage of an Ionic framework is templates. You can utilize more than 100 default UI components like forms, filters, action sheets, list views, tab bars, and navigation menu in their design. It encourages devs to focus on creating applications rather than getting bogged down working on UI components. On the off chance that the designers know about CSS, JavaScript, or HTML, utilizing the Ionic structure turns out to be significantly more reasonable. It supports Android 4.1+ & iOS 7 and above versions. Additionally, if engineers utilize Ionic with a local versatile application in PhoneGap, it works even better than hybrid applications. Source Some famous apps built with React Native: PhoneGap is a widely adopted framework for cross-platform mobile app development. The core of the framework runs on HTML5, CSS3 which gives it the capabilities to access underlying hardware like your camera, accelerometer, and GPS. It also uses Javascript to render the backend logic for applications. This gives it a competitive edge as Javascript is very widely used in programming.

Many of the top platforms (e.g., Google and Facebook) provide an ad management panel that allows you to create an account and manage ads yourself.",
        "body": "Introducing Postclick - the first \"guaranteed higher advertising conversion\" solution With people spending over 5 hours per day on their smartphone, delivering ads via mobile ad platforms is a huge opportunity for companies to market their brand. But what type of ads can you deliver? There are numerous ad types, but the most popular ones include: All of these ads can be delivered by using a mobile ad platform, sometimes referred to as a mobile ad network. Two of the most obvious choices include Google Ads or Facebook. A mobile ad platform works like a broker between publishers and advertisers who are looking for advertising real estate on popular apps. In this article, you’ll learn how mobile ad platforms work, discover some of the top mobile ad platforms, what they all have in common, and how to choose the right platform for your business. Techopedia defines a mobile ad platform as an “intermediary between mobile publishers and advertisers.” In layman’s terms, a mobile ad platform is a place where advertisers can purchase ad spots that are delivered on mobile websites and apps. Many of the top platforms (e.g., Google and Facebook) provide an ad management panel that allows you to create an account and manage ads yourself. In this case, there’s no need to reach out to the advertiser directly, and you can easily view data on impressions, conversions, click-through-rates, etc. as all of this data is tracked by the ad platform. Often, you can set an ad campaign spend limit with multiple bid options to choose from, such as cost-per-impression (CPM) or cost-per-click (CPC). You can use a mobile ad platform to target a variety of different channels including: These platforms work two-ways. They allow publishers to sell ads (and earn advertising revenue) and allow advertisers to serve ads to potential customers and showcase their brand. With the basics out of the way, let’s take a look at some of the best ad platforms for mobile advertising.  With Google ads, ads can show on both desktop and mobile devices. When using display ads, you can use device targeting to target only smartphone and/or tablet users. On this platform, you can publish ads within apps, browsers, and Google search results. Here are the types of ads you can use on smartphones and tablets:  Due to its large user base, the social media giant launched Audience Network, an easy-to-use ad platform. Facebook is well-known for its many advertising targeting options, and now they’ve given advertisers the option to choose from the following ad types: Instagram is another good option for advertisers since it’s a mobile-first platform created with the mobile audience in mind. Both Facebook and Instagram ads are managed via Facebook’s ad platform.   While Bing may have smaller market share than Google, your advertising budget could spread farther on the 2nd place search engine. On average, you will pay 70% less for Bing Ads than Google. On a search engine that receives 5 billion searches every month, that istremendous value. Lower costs aren't the only advantage of using their Bing's mobile ad platform, though. With Bing Ads, you have more control over the language, location, and scheduling of your campaign (as these can be set on the ad group level vs. the campaign level in Google). You can use the Social Extensions app to drive traffic to your social media accounts:  Bing has also developed some valuable partnerships over the years. For example, if you want to target Kindle users, you should know that Bing is the default search engine for Kindle Fire devices. If you’re debating between using Google or Bing ads, read, “Bing Ads vs. Google AdWords: The Pros & Cons of Each Platform.”  Since being acquired by Google in November 2009, AdMob has become one of the most popular mobile ad platforms. The platform is beneficial for companies aiming to monetize by showing ads in their mobile app. AdMob allows users to decide what types of ads they want to show and to set filters, so only relevant ads are shown. Within the ad network, four types of ads are available: Advertisers that want to take advantage of these in-app placements can use Google Ads to show up in AdMob ad locations.  AdColony is a popular mobile video ad network used successfully by companies such as Hilton Hotels, Adidas, and Farmville. With AdColony, publishers can show video ads during in-app usage. As an example, the platform is popular with mobile game developers to show a video ad after the user has completed a task or achieved a certain level. The platform can be used to target by:  TubeMogul (powered by Adobe) is a demand-side, mobile ad serving platform that started the non-human traffic credit program in 2016, concerned that their clients might be flooded with non-human traffic. In short, this program uses a sensor to detect fraudulent traffic (e.g. visits from bots). As a DSP, this means that it aggregates data and publishers from a large number of sources. Rest assured that when you advertise with TubeMogul, your ads will be seen and clicked by real people.  Airpush is the second largest mobile ad platform for Android, yet advertising through IOS is also available. The platform features 12 different ad formats, some of which include: Regardless of the ad type available, the best mobile ad platforms have the following common traits: As an advertiser, a large inventory is a necessity. This allows you to chose the ad placements (e.g. search ads, display ads, in-app ads, etc.) that make sense for your business. Another must-have feature is analytics and targeting. Without having a clear idea of who sees your ad and which ads perform best, mobile ads are a waste of time and money. Key metrics include CPC or CPM, the total number of conversions, and CTR. The most important criteria when choosing the right ad platform is identifying who your buyer persona is and tailoring the ad accordingly. It would help if you answered all of these questions before deciding on a specific platform. Example Knowing that your target audience primarily uses IOS devices, uses Bing to search, spends most of their time on Instagram, and plays games like Farmville or Candy Crush can help decide where to put your advertising budget (ex: You'll want to make sure your chosen ad platform includes IOS targeting options and you may look at Bing and Instagram mobile ads). If you haven’t defined your target audience yet, this list of 101 questions will help you figure out who your ideal customers are. Your industry also plays a big role in what mobile ad platform you should use. Here's a breakdown of some of the most popular ad platforms, their aggregate reach to Android users, and the percentage of that reach divided by industry:  In short, the right mobile ad platform should give you the creative flexibility of creating a high-quality ad and be an industry and budget fit. Unfortunately, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. Depending on your advertising goals, budget, and industry, there are several options to choose from. But it's a good start to look at the statistics for each solution for a mobile ad platform comparison. The chart below is based on the number of installs and reach of some of the biggest mobile ad platforms existing today:  With over 5,000 advertising platforms to choose from, it can be intimidating to select ad platforms that are suitable for your campaigns. Google Ads, Facebook/Instagram, Bing, AdMob, the list goes on and on. With that many ad platforms available, it's a challenge to decide which ones to focus your attention and advertising budget.

        "body": "As they say, to err is human. It is human to make mistakes, but inhuman to abandon. And abandoning an idea is a sin. The mobile platform allows you to integrate the services of your company in the most efficient way possible. Apps are easily the best approach to establish your brand in an era where mobile apps impact every element of our life. An app is also a natural marketing tool. Do you want to start a business? Do you want to know the cost of making such apps? Do you want to introduce new mobile app concepts? The concept of creating an app is an important aspect of starting a successful company. It’s also critical to find the top mobile development companies in India to supply you with a team of professional offshore mobile app developers to help you construct a multibillion-dollar app without thinking about the crucial steps to creating such applications. We’ve compiled a list of 10 mobile app ideas that are expected to be popular in 2022. One of the main considerations when purchasing furniture or any other type of interior decoration is whether the item will fit in your room and where it will look best. An augmented reality software allows you to use your phone’s camera to place 3D representations of various goods and furnishings in a virtual location and see how they might appear. The app may also form partnerships with numerous shopping sites, allowing users to place orders directly from the app. Why should you let go an opportunity to dine at a fantastic location? For last-minute planning. This software will provide a graphical representation of neighboring pubs and restaurants, as well as the ability to reserve a certain table at a given time. As a result, it might be one of the most effective and straightforward application concepts. This app uses Artificial Intelligence to remember the user’s preferences and provide recommendations based on them. AI not only assists in the selection of superior dining establishments, but also makes them more customized. Do you want to create an AI-powered app? Hire mobile app developers adroit at creating Ai-powered apps on a full-time, hourly, or project-by-project basis and manage them as an extension of your staff to create a feature-packed app. Apps for food delivery are not a new concept. It’s been a while since they’ve made an appearance in people’s daily lives and phrases like ‘I’ll Swiggy in my lunch and Zomato that steak’ has slipped into our daily vocabulary. Covid-19, on the other hand, has boosted the rise of meal delivery applications. So now is the ideal moment to try your hand at developing a meal delivery app with some fresh ideas. For instance, an app that employs augmented reality to produce interactive menu cards to help consumers make better ordering decisions. This would give your food delivery app a new dimension and attract more clients. Mobile health technology better known as mHealth gives healthcare providers all the necessary information they may need at their fingertips. It also empowers patients to get engaged in their own healthcare. Doctors, patients, and healthcare providers have all benefitted from digital healthcare services. Doctor appointment apps are a valuable mobile app concept that may assist all parties involved to save time and effort. It might be an app that allows patients to arrange appointments on their own or through a physician. Patients would save time and money by not having to drive great distances or wait in big lines if they use such booking apps. The creation of doctor appointment apps is on the increase, and now is the best moment to invest in one. Payment apps based on the Unified Payments Interface, or UPI, are all the rage these days. It’s a real-time interbank payment system that lets you send and receive money. Money may be sent/requested using account number/IFSC code, cellphone number, virtual payment address, Aadhaar number, and even QR code if many bank accounts are linked to a single app. For nearly 6 million years, our forefathers have wandered this planet. As a result, the type of illnesses they discovered differs from place to location. People nowadays travel extensively outside of their hometowns. As a result, the basic components for such age-old Granny treatments may not always be available. As a result, the app concept to create a separate healthcare app was born. We offer an app that has a database of all home remedies, which is organized mostly along regional and cultural lines. The user’s present location will determine the type of medicine he or she can try. There’s also a requirement to categorize treatments according to their symptoms and illnesses. As a final resort, “call the doctor” can be included. Some of the big players in the market are PharmEasy and Netmeds. The fitness app can help fitness enthusiasts keep track of their daily calorie intake and workout condition. You can incorporate a chat feature that allows users to communicate with health experts and other members of the community. MyFitnessPal and Adidas Runtastic have changed the complexion of the industry by empowering the average joe to strive for fitness. People no longer think twice about conducting online purchases thanks to the Classified App. Buying and selling items online has grown quite prevalent in recent years. The popularity of classified applications such as OLX, Quikr, eBay, Go Local Classified and others demonstrates this. Classified applications are more adaptable and have a wider reach than e-commerce apps. Whether you have products to sell, want to assist people in finding the right buyer/seller, or want to use classified app development for marketing purposes, classified app development has you covered. Taxi app services have been in high demand since the start of Uber. Online taxi services will be used by 1588 million individuals by 2024. Even though it necessitates a certain amount of commitment, the good news is that you may double your investment within a financial year. The level of services you provide will determine the app’s success. Taxi app development is a viable industry to go into if you can guarantee high-quality service. Many shop owners and members of the general public have security systems installed in their homes. This program will use wi-fi to operate all these security devices, allowing the user to answer the door, examine camera video, and monitor locker/safe activity all from their smartphone. This is an idea that can be realized via the use of IoT app development and Blockchain development. For music enthusiasts, this may be one of the finest app ideas. This app will appear to be a standard mp3 player at first glance, but it will offer much more. It will notify people in the user’s contact list of what they are listening to, and if they like it, they will be able to share it with them so that they may both listen at the same time.

        "body": "Cash is so last century, and touching a credit card reader isn't COVID-friendly. Fortunately, we've tested the top apps for using your phone to make contactless payments in stores, pay friends, and shop online so that you can pick the one that's right for you. Thanks to alternative digital payment solutions like those we round up here, words like cashless and contactless have entered the vernacular. Like other tech areas, digital transactions have taken on greater importance in the face of the current COVID-19 health crisis. You no longer have to dig into your pocket and withdraw virus-covered bills and coins or even your credit card and hand them to a cashier. Instead, just pay with your smartphone. Not only can you pay this way at Macy's or McDonald's, but you can also pay your friends and acquaintances for outings, goods, or services. You can also use many of the apps included here to pay on web stores and within some apps. Some of these services don't even require you to install a separate app: With Apple Pay, in-store payments are built into the Wallet app and person-to-person payments happen inside the Messages app. Zelle is most often available from your particular bank's app, rather than as its own separate app. Facebook Messenger lets you pay contacts in chat conversations. Probably the most buzzworthy mobile payment option is peer-to-peer payments, as exemplified by Venmo. There are plenty of other choices for paying your friends directly, however. Apple Pay Cash, Circle Pay, Facebook Payments, Google Pay, PayPal, Square Cash, and Zelle all let you settle up with other people. With Apple Pay, you can only pay contacts who have iPhones, though, whereas Venmo and the rest are cross-platform services. When you receive money, most apps store your money in a holding place, a sort of limited bank account. Zelle and Google Pay are the exceptions here, delivering funds directly to the recipient's bank account. Several of the apps, like Venmo, require a fee to dump money from your app account into your bank account (see next section). Most person-to-person payments are free with these apps, unless you use a credit card rather than a bank account or debit card. A fee of about 3 percent comes from the credit card provider when you use that as your payment source. But keep in mind that you still get cash-back points with some cards—and you may even get bonus points for using mobile payments—so you'll want to do the math to see which payment method benefits you most. Some services charge yet another fee when you want to transfer received money to your bank account. Square Cash charges 1 percent for this if you enable its auto-deposit feature, and Venmo charges 25 cents per expedited deposit. Zelle is the best deal here: Because it's connected to the banks, sent money goes straight into your bank account, rather than into the payment service account. Google Pay doesn't charge to dump money into your bank account. Another situation in which you'll pay even higher fees is international transfers. For details, see the International Support section below. The services vary in how much they let you pay, but they generally increase your maximum allowed payment with increased usage. Venmo and Square Cash start you out with a cap of $300 per week. Zelle's limits are determined by your bank. The Ally online bank, for example, limits you to sending up to $5,000 per day and $10,000 per month via Zelle. Google Pay lets you send up to $10,000 per week right off the bat. A few of the apps included here let you pay stores as well as your friends. Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Samsung Pay are strong contenders in this area. Apple has outpaced all other comers in in-store contactless payments. Samsung Pay is distinguished in that it works wherever a magnetic stripe card does, though those have largely been replaced by the more secure NFC point-of-sale devices. The PayPal app also can be used to pay in a selection of stores, though it doesn't support the direct NFC wireless payments that Apple Pay and Google Pay do. For us, there's nothing so satisfying as feeling the haptic \"clunk\" you get when an Apple Pay transaction completes. Square Cash is a bit of a hybrid in this category: You can't pay in stores with the app per se, but the service will send you a debit card that you can use with any balance you've accrued in your Square Cash account from others paying you. Only a couple of the apps and services included in this roundup can support payments to people abroad. The separate category of international remittance apps includes Xoom, which lets users send payments to people in 66 countries without the recipient needing the app or even a smartphone: They can simply pick of the cash in local currency at a nearby bank with a code and an ID. As mentioned above, you incur greater fees for this cross-border convenience. When you send money to Guatemala, for example, Xoom charges $4.99 if you use a bank account and $6.99 for a credit card, along with whatever exchange-rate fee it may impose. This varies greatly by country: For payments to Finland, you pay nothing when using a bank account, but when using a credit card, you pay about 3 percent of the transaction amount. PayPal lets you send money to over 200 countries, but the recipient needs a PayPal account. For in-store payments, Samsung Pay works in 17 countries beyond the US, and Google Pay works in the UK as well as in the US. Apple Pay works in stores in 26 countries, but person-to-person payments only work with U.S. accounts. Many of the services let you pay via a web browser rather than solely through an app. PayPal is famous for this, and Venmo, Xoom, Google Pay, and others offer web interfaces as well. Apple Pay is weak in this area, since it only works in Safari on a Mac that's in the proximity of your iPhone. Samsung Pay can only make web payments if you link a Visa Checkout account, but it works on the company's phones and (very well) on its smart watches. Apple Pay works on the Apple Watch, as you might expect, and there are a few Google Wear OS watches that support Google Pay. The apps and services that support in-store payments all use anonymized tokens, encrypted versions of your credit card number. The actual number isn't transferred, so it's actually safer than handing over your plastic. All of the services, because they transmit credit card information, must comply with the PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)—the same standard used with analog payment cards. That includes things like implementing newer transport security than SSL and early TLS. Further, most banks have a zero-liability policy for credit card fraud, meaning if you've been cheated, you don't have to pay anything (with certain reasonable limitations). By law, the maximum you could be responsible for is $50. Most of the services also use fraud detection technology to protect you, as well. But person-to-person payments not involving credit cards are a whole different story: There's no protection for Venmo or Zelle money transfers to speak of. Once you pay someone in the app, you should consider it the equivalent of handing over cash, and equally easy or hard to get back. That's one reason why you should never use the p2p services to pay businesses or buy things on the internet with them: You could end up losing your money and not getting the product you thought you bought. Another thing to be on the lookout for with these services is getting payments or requests for money from those you don't know. Well-known scams involve someone sending you a bunch of money through the app and asking you for repayment. A common scam is that the source of the payment to you comes from a stolen credit card. If you accept that money, you could find yourself in deep legal doo-doo. The services included here often do more than just let you pay. There are a various extra perks that some offer such as those listed below. Splitting Payments. Say your group of pals went to a fancy restaurant for a birthday celebration. How do you all pay your fair share? Many payment apps and services let you split a payment—simply enter the full amount and all the contacts that need to chip in. Of course, they need to be signed up with the payment service you're using. Order ahead. LevelUp and others hook into local eateries and let you put in an order so that your lunch is ready for you to pick up when you arrive. It's similar to what's offered by some merchant-specific apps like the Starbucks app. Loyalty cards. Many of the apps and services here let you enter loyalty program information to let you keep accruing those reward points. LevelUp, PayPal, Samsung Pay, and Google Pay are strong in this area. Gift cards. Several of these apps offer a convenient way to combine all your cash or store gift cards. Usually you just have to snap a picture of the card and maybe enter a code to make the money available from the payment app. Bitcoin and Investing. Only Square Cash among the apps included here let you purchase and sell Bitcoin, but you're probably using Coinbase or another cryptocurrency wallet if you're a Bitcoin fan. Square Cash also makes it easy to buy fractional stocks: For example, you want some Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A), but don't have the $317,000 price of a single share. Pick up $100 worth in your Square Cash app. Credit Cards and ATM Cards. The highest-profile example of this is the Apple Card, which offers 2 percent rewards (3 percent for Apple products) and some other nifty options. PayPal and Venmo both offer credit and debit cards, and Square Cash's debit card occasionally offers some very deep discounts. Samsung offers a card and a no-fee, interest-bearing money management account provided by SoFi.

Procreate offers an accessible drawing experience whether you're a design professional, a seasoned digital artist or a beginner to the world of digital drawing. If you're looking for the photo effects app that does it all, PicsArt Photo Studio might be right up your alley, but be warned that it can get a bit overwhelming. Apple Music has a lot of potential, but its iCloud Music Library bugs and confusing interface keep it from edging out Spotify for now. Manything can't match the video quality and options of some traditional Wi-Fi cameras, but there's no easier way for iOS users to experiment with DIY home security.

If you're looking for an app to help you name that tune, SoundHound is it. For a dead simple editor that can put together video clips in a flash, WeVideo impresses. But know that it lacks any truly powerful tools to make granular edits. For those, you'll have to upload your project to the Web and finish from a computer. With an intuitive interface, reliable tools and artistic touches, Google Calendar is easily one of the best apps in its category.

After checking out the best app development platforms, we will compare the listed platforms based on their prices, supported programming languages, ratings, and cross-platform deployment support. We have prepared this table with the help of G2 that is the top review website. So, let’s get started: As per the above comparison, we can say that both Alpha Anywhere and Flutter are the best platforms, considering their features, ratings, and overall support. Now, you know almost all the information about these 11 best platforms for app development, so you shouldn’t miss its most valuable features to select the best one. Here are the most valuable features and criteria to select the right platform that makes your work easier.  Whenever you plan to develop enterprise apps or consumer apps with the MADP, ensure you look for this feature. In an era where the mobile ecosystem is evolving with several platforms, devices, and other factors, it is essential to opt for a MADP that supports multi-platforms. Your decision would be investing in a cross-platform mobile application development platform that helps you with integrating and modifying various features across all the devices and OS platforms, such as the Web, Android, and iOS. We expect our mobile apps to run seamlessly without any significant glitch. However, the mobile app often contains several sensitive information, such as payment details and a contact list. Losing a mobile device can haunt anyone. Therefore, it will require an additional layer of security. A MADP must provide secure management of user data and information. In such cases, you must ensure to prevent data using a reliable mobile development app platform. It is often observed that many clients integrate new and improved features in the next stage of app development. So, if you have the probability of integrating new features into your app once it is developed, then choose a platform that can match your requirements and help you to integrate the features later. The fact is that the app developer community is highly dependent on open source libraries and APIs, and there is no denying that it plays an essential role in increasing the speed, integration, and delivery of the app development process. Therefore, make sure you choose a platform that gives complete freedom and easy access and integration with such libraries. Most enterprise apps try to offer a rich user experience and choose agile ways of development. In most cases, user feedback triggers the best use of the app. This allows app developers to accommodate necessary changes in a swift manner. And where MADPs play an essential role. It helps to convert the user data into visual insights. Therefore, a good MADP provides easy monitoring of app performance and analytics. The benefit of mobile app development tools is that they provide a collaboration platform for developing, testing, debugging, deploying, hosting, and maintaining mobile apps more effortlessly. If you want to build your app for Play Store, then choose Android Studio, an app development tool. Otherwise, you can select Xcode for the App Store. Many hosts prefer a low code app development for their project with pre-designed templates and drag-and-drop app builders support. Because of its promising nature, many developers prefer a CLI, which provides high agility for setting up and managing the development environment. Choose a platform that will be comfortable for the developer because restrictions with CLI can be frustrating and may hamper time. The benefit of using a MADP is that you can deploy it on-premise and available as a cloud-based service. You can easily start without any significant upfront costs with cloud services. However, an on-premise subscription will give you higher levels of security at a lower cost if you are in the long run. Make sure you choose the right way and invest in a MADP that can fulfill the requirements of your developers. There is no doubt that technology has advanced over the years. Everyone expects more with each advanced version. If you have also planned to integrate any features into an app after creating a minimal viable product (MVP), then you must focus on this feature. And this is the reason you must opt for a platform that can evolve over the years with the changing technological requirements. Create Your Own App We design and develop custom mobile applications. Usually, there is no limit on creating mobile apps. You can create many mobile apps using an application builder. There are many types of MADPs.

Wirecutter is reader-supported. When you buy through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more. FYI Our upgrade pick, ScanPro, has been rebranded as SwiftScan. We’ve updated the guide accordingly. January 25, 2021 This may seem shocking, but unless you’re an accountant or archivist, you probably don’t need a traditional scanner—today’s smartphone scanning apps are simply that good. After spending more than 35 hours researching 20 scanning apps and testing seven of them, we’ve determined that our favorite is the lean and efficient Adobe Scan (for Android and iOS). It’s dead simple to use, capable of beautiful scan quality, and equipped with excellent text-recognition capabilities. Best of all, it’s totally free—even for iPhone owners. Free and refreshingly straightforward, Adobe Scan is the perfect app if all you need is clean PDFs and reliable text recognition. Adobe Scan (for Android and iOS) is great at capturing the sort of documents life throws at you on a once-in-a-while basis—stuff like rebate forms, tax documents, and the occasional business card. It isn’t as complex or powerful as apps like CamScanner or our upgrade pick, SwiftScan, and it can export only PDFs. But its simplicity means it’s extremely easy to use, and its scans look even better than those from other top scanning apps. It automatically stores every scan you capture on Adobe Document Cloud, so your scans are accessible from any phone, tablet, or computer. And its useful dedicated scanning modes mean you can add new contacts from business cards and fill out forms right on your device. ADVERTISEMENT Office Lens is especially good if you use Microsoft Office, but it’s a solid option for anyone who wants free scanning with (mostly) properly formatted OCR results. If you like the sound of Adobe Scan’s simplicity but spend a lot of time working in the Microsoft Office suite, Microsoft Office Lens (Android and iOS) is the way to go. Its user interface is similarly stripped down, but the output options include Word documents and PowerPoint slides in addition to PDFs. Its scans don’t look as clean as what you can get from Adobe Scan or SwiftScan, and you may find its sharing options annoyingly limited. But its world-class text recognition almost makes up for those drawbacks. SwiftScan's extra features and sharing options make it a more versatile, powerful app than Adobe Scan or Office Lens. But that versatility comes at a cost, especially for iOS users. SwiftScan (formerly ScanPro) (Android and iOS) is a more full-featured app than Adobe Scan or Office Lens, offering stuff like custom folders for better organization, smart file naming, iCloud syncing, and automatic uploading to your choice of more than a dozen cloud storage services. SwiftScan produces good-looking scans across a variety of document types, including books, business cards, and even photos. It can perform OCR in dozens of languages, and the results are very good, if not quite best in class. However, the iOS app relies on a relatively expensive subscription model, and the more affordable (non-subscription) Android app isn’t as fully developed as the iOS version (though it’s still more feature-rich than our other picks). Ultimately, we think SwiftScan makes sense only for people who really need the extra features.

Free and refreshingly straightforward, Adobe Scan is the perfect app if all you need is clean PDFs and reliable text recognition. Office Lens is especially good if you use Microsoft Office, but it’s a solid option for anyone who wants free scanning with (mostly) properly formatted OCR results. SwiftScan's extra features and sharing options make it a more versatile, powerful app than Adobe Scan or Office Lens. But that versatility comes at a cost, especially for iOS users. I’ve been writing about imaging gear—including cameras, printers, and scanners—for more than a decade, and I’ve been using smartphone scanning apps for nearly as long. Wirecutter has been covering scanners since 2013, spending more than 170 total hours on research and testing to find the best of the best. The knowledge we’ve picked up along the way has informed our testing of these mobile scanning apps. Virtually anyone can benefit from having a scanning app on their phone, and for most people it can completely replace a physical scanner. Don’t get us wrong—there are plenty of specific tasks for which it still makes sense to own a scanner. But if you need one, you almost certainly know already. (Hello, CPAs and tax lawyers.) If you find yourself merely wondering whether you need one, the answer is almost certainly no. That may come as a surprise, but thanks to rapidly improving smartphone cameras, today’s scanning apps are perfectly capable of handling once-in-a-while scanning needs: receipts, business cards, legal documents, or the occasional form. And because your phone can go almost anywhere you can, scanning apps can also go places physical scanners can’t. You can, for instance, use an app to quickly scan receipts at a business lunch, to capture pages from rare books at a library, or even to send in bills of lading and trip reports from big-rig trucks on long-haul routes. Here’s a quick rundown of the major reasons why you might want a dedicated scanner, and which kind you need: Otherwise, save yourself some money and give a scanning app a try. You can find dozens upon dozens of mobile scanning apps on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, most of which have glowing reviews and attractive-sounding features. But as with most apps, a lot of them are junk. To narrow the field, we isolated the traits we think are most useful in a mobile scanning app: For the original version of this guide, we tested six contenders for Android (ABBYY FineScanner, Clear Scan, Microsoft Office Lens, SwiftScan, and Smart Doc Scanner) and seven for iOS (ABBYY FineScanner, CamScanner, ClearScanner, Microsoft Office Lens, Prizmo, SwiftScan, and Scanner Pro). For the summer 2019 update, we checked all of the above apps again and added Adobe Scan (Android, iOS) and Genius Scan (Android, iOS). We downloaded each Android app using a Google Pixel XL and each iOS app on an Apple iPhone 8. Where freeware versions were available, we took stock of what functionality was available without our upgrading to a “Pro” or “Premium” version of the app. This step was especially important since we hoped to recommend a free or freeware app for each platform. Then we grabbed the paid versions of the apps and got down to serious scanning. Using each app, we scanned two documents—a standard IRS 1099 tax form (PDF) and a simple text document with the same sentence repeated in descending font size from 12 to 4 points—three times each in order to test OCR accuracy and consistency. Where cloud-based OCR was available, we tried that feature to see if it offered a noticeable improvement over on-device text recognition. We scanned the 1099 form again to check out each app’s batch-scanning mode, taking note of any hitches in the process and how easy it was to reorder or recapture specific pages. Then we scanned a handwritten note, a whiteboard, a business card, a page from a book, and both glossy and matte photos to see how the apps handled different kinds of source material. During all of this scanning, we kept detailed notes on the quality of each app’s edge detection, automatic cropping, and image filter performance. Once we had the scans in hand, we spent time playing with the annotation and editing options in order to see how extensively each app could manipulate the images it captured. Finally, we spent significant time going through the apps’ sharing options, looking for snags that might catch you out, such as an inability to directly share certain file types, a lack of automatic uploading, or a limited selection of sharing channels. Free and refreshingly straightforward, Adobe Scan is the perfect app if all you need is clean PDFs and reliable text recognition. If, like most people, you just need to occasionally create clean-looking PDFs of physical documents—and do it for free—we think there’s no better option than Adobe Scan (Android, iOS). Adobe Scan’s simple design and limited options may initially seem like a negative in comparison with the features in more complex apps like SwiftScan and CamScanner, but we found in practice that the app’s simplicity made it easier to get the results we wanted. Adobe Scan produced the cleanest-looking scans in our test group, from text docs to photos. It also has the ability to fill in scanned forms (with the help of other free apps in the Adobe ecosystem), and it provides excellent text recognition, too. And it automatically stores all of your scans in Adobe’s cloud, at no additional cost. Adobe Scan’s layout is as simple as they come. When you fire up the app, it dumps you right into the camera view so you can quickly capture the document in front of you. Here you’ll find dedicated modes for whiteboards, forms, documents, and business cards. You can also toggle auto-capture, choose from several flash options, and import documents or images that are already on your device for OCR. The app can handily capture a single scan or dozens in a row; you tell it when to stop scanning and then proceed to add the finishing touches. This process differs slightly from that of other apps (like SwiftScan) that have a dedicated multipage mode, but in practice it makes little difference. When you do proceed to the editing screen, you can apply one of four filters, adjust the automatic crop, rotate the image, reorder multipage scans, or add more pages. The library view is simple, showing either a grid or a list of scans, sorted by name or date. OCR is available in 19 of the most commonly spoken languages—fewer than in SwiftScan or ABBYY FineScanner, but sufficient for the needs of a huge percentage of the world population. It was very accurate in our testing, matching the class-leading FineScanner at typical font sizes with perfect results down to about 8 points. If OCR is extremely important to you, or if you scan a lot of especially fine text, you would get more accurate results from FineScanner or a hardware document scanner. However, both options are far more expensive than Adobe Scan. Adobe’s auto-crop was reliably on point in our tests, with only occasional, minor adjustments required as long as we were scanning white pages on a darker surface. If you try to scan at crazy angles, or with a low-contrast background, you’ll need to adjust your crop lines. But Adobe helps you out there with a magnified view that makes it simple to pinpoint the corners of pages. Unlike in some other apps we tested, Adobe Scan’s Auto Color filter actually retains accurate color and contrast (even in smaller text) while brightening white areas and getting rid of the shadows caused by creases. It was the only app we tested that was able to correctly render the photo of the dog in our standard office document. Whereas other apps stripped color out of the sky or the dog’s face, Adobe Scan produced natural color gradients throughout. It performed similarly well on photos, though with glossy prints we had to work hard to avoid glare. We don’t recommend using a scanning app for photo reproduction, but it’s nice that this one works in a pinch. We loved Adobe’s Fill & Sign feature, which lets you scan a form and send it to the (also free) Acrobat Reader app for checking boxes, filling in fields with typewritten text, and signing with your finger (or a saved image of your signature). It’s quick and intuitive, and when I filled out a scanned rebate form for a recently purchased PC power supply, the printed results looked startlingly similar to the original document. If you have a downloaded form, you can even import it directly—rather than printing it and scanning it—to make the ultimate image quality even better. All scans you capture with Adobe Scan save as PDFs, and the appy automatically uploads them to Adobe Document Cloud. You can also choose to share a copy of any PDF via the Android or iOS sharing menu, or send someone a link to download the file from Adobe Document Cloud. You can export any scan as a JPEG, too, in case you want to send it to someone via text message or upload to Instagram. Although having a copy of every scan you make stored on Adobe’s servers may be a concern for the extremely security-conscious, we believe Adobe is one of the safest services you could use. Adobe provides a thorough rundown of its security policies (PDF) if you need reassurance. If you need a more secure storage option or just don’t like Adobe, consider an app (such as SwiftScan) that allows you to automatically upload each scan to the storage service of your choice. Adobe Scan is refreshingly simple and direct, but that simplicity means it’s lacking a few extras that we’d like to see in our ideal scanning app. The most obvious limitation is that since the app is made by Adobe, it’s extremely PDF-oriented. You can also’t export scans as JPEGs, but there’s no option for Word docs or, TXT files for OCR’d text, or PowerPoint slides to help you create a presentation. The other thing is that the only cloud storage option is, yep, Adobe Document Cloud. Sure, you can individually upload scans to any other cloud storage app you have on your device, but we’d prefer it if Adobe let you set up automatic uploads to, say, Google Drive, Dropbox, Evernote, and other popular services. And speaking of the cloud, it would be great if the cloud uploads were optional. As it stands, every scan you make in Adobe Scan automatically uploads to Adobe’s servers, which could be a concern for the most security-conscious people. When you’re scanning things like personal financial records, legal documents, and business contracts, you want to be sure nefarious outside interests can’t access those files. File management in Adobe Scan is limited, and the search function indexes only the names of the scans (which you have to manually edit). Other, more powerful scanning apps, like SwiftScan, let you create folders to organize your scans, offer smart file naming, and can index the OCR-captured contents of each scan instead of just the title. Office Lens is especially good if you use Microsoft Office, but it’s a solid option for anyone who wants free scanning with (mostly) properly formatted OCR results. While Adobe Scan is focused almost entirely on PDFs, Microsoft Office Lens (available for Android and iOS) is unsurprisingly geared toward working with Microsoft’s Office suite. The app generates reliably excellent OCR results and can export them as fully formatted Word or RTF files in addition to the usual searchable PDFs. When you’re scanning business cards, it can recognize and export the contact info to OneNote, and its whiteboard mode can generate PowerPoint slides. Its image filters aren’t as effective as Adobe Scan’s, though, and it lacks a form-filling feature like the handy Fill & Sign, so unless you really need the Office-specific output formats, we think Adobe Scan is a better choice. Office Lens’s layout is straightforward, with few distractions. It opens directly to the camera and offers a quartet of scanning modes along the bottom of the screen: Whiteboard, Document, Business Card, and Photo. The app automatically recognizes documents and outlines them with an orange box, but it has no auto-capture functionality; you have to hit the shutter button yourself. After you capture the scan, the app auto-crops it and gives you the option to add text overlays or to use a pen tool to annotate it. Office Lens performs OCR automatically on Word and PDF exports. The results we got in DOCX format were excellent: well-formatted and accurate down to about 6 points, making Office Lens more accurate than SwiftScan, on a par with Adobe Scan, and close to what you’d get from the class-leading ABBYY FineScanner. The only catch with the OCR in Office Lens is that you have to install Word (it’s free) to access the DOCX output on your mobile device. (Alternatively, you can use the PDF output and open it with your default PDF reader, but in that case you’re better off with Adobe Scan.) Once you’ve opened your file in Word, you can share it through any app you like. (Note that you need to sign in to Word with a free Microsoft account in order to edit and save your OCR files.) The scans we got from Office Lens didn’t look quite as clean as those from rival scanning apps. Whites weren’t as bright, the filters weren’t very good at getting rid of shadows, and the auto-crop tended to leave slivers of the background around the piece of paper. (It occasionally whiffed entirely, as well, including a huge swath of my desktop.) You can adjust the crop, but unlike other scanning apps, Office Lens doesn’t provide a magnified view for pinpoint adjustments. Like Adobe Scan, Office Lens is laser-focused on its particular ecosystem, and is thus short on extras. File management is pretty much nonexistent, it offers no option to password-protect files, and it has no way to automatically upload scans to other cloud storage services. SwiftScan's extra features and sharing options make it a more versatile, powerful app than Adobe Scan or Office Lens. But that versatility comes at a cost, especially for iOS users. SwiftScan (available for Android and iOS) combines excellent scan quality and solid OCR results with a logical, easy-to-use layout. It also offers more extras than Adobe Scan and Microsoft Office Lens—stuff like file organization, advanced file-naming templates, additional PDF-markup features, automatic uploads to various cloud services, and PDF encryption. However, the iOS version of SwiftScan relies on subscription pricing ($6 per month or $35 per year) that makes it vastly more expensive than Adobe and Microsoft’s free apps. The more affordable Android app, meanwhile, doesn’t require a subscription but lacks some of the iOS version’s features. Either way, unless you really need some of its added features, we don’t think SwiftScan is worth choosing over our other picks. Most scanning apps have similar layouts, but SwiftScan’s is our favorite thanks to its elegant simplicity. When you fire it up, it automatically opens the camera and captures the document in front of you. (If you prefer, you can set it to go to your library instead, and you can turn auto-capture off.) We also like its dedicated multipage scanning mode, its reminders to rotate the camera for landscape documents, and its prompts to square up your scans when there’s too much perspective distortion. However, it’s missing one thing we like in Adobe Scan and Microsoft Office Lens: dedicated modes for different content types. SwiftScan does have a unique feature called Actions that analyzes OCR results and extracts actionable elements such as URLs and email addresses, but we found that feature only marginally useful in practice. The captured document goes to the editing screen, where you can apply an array of filters, adjust the automatic crop, rotate it, and name the scanned file. (You can also set up a custom naming template, if you don’t want to name your documents each time you scan.) The library view is straightforward, grouping your scans by capture date. From there, you can tap into each scan, view the recognized text, annotate the PDF, and share it. You can also create folders to better organize your scans—a feature no other scanning app we tested offers—and you have an option to make folders show up at the top of the library view. (Folders are available only in the iOS version of SwiftScan, however.) SwiftScan performs automatic OCR on every scan, and can do so in 104 languages in the Android app and 60 in the iOS app (including options like Cherokee and Middle French). In our testing, its results were nowhere near as accurate as what we’d get from a hardware document scanner but still ranked near the top of the pack for scanning apps. ABBYY FineScanner and, to a lesser extent, Adobe Scan and Microsoft Office Lens still outclass it, but SwiftScan is fine for quick OCR work. The auto-cropping functionality was reliably excellent, producing clean edges and straight text. In the rare cases when it messes up, SwiftScans cropping tool snaps to the detected edges of documents and has a magnified view to help you precisely place the corners. The two “Magic” image filters—Magic Color and Magic Text—reliably enhanced contrast and eliminated shadows and creases in our scans, leaving clean, white backgrounds and clear, readable text. SwiftScan also did a better job with photos than most apps, with the Color filter producing natural colors and contrast even as it removed shadows and other aberrations. We don’t recommend using scanning apps for photo reproduction, but we like that this one works in a pinch. SwiftScan lets you share scans via email with one touch (PDF only), or you can tap the Share button to bring up the familiar Android or iOS share menu (PDF or JPEG). You can also share OCR results as a TXT file or copy it to your clipboard. In addition, you can configure SwiftScan to automatically upload all scans (again, PDF only) to one of 17 cloud services, including popular storage services such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive; note-taking apps like OneNote and Evernote; and more esoteric options such as FTP servers and WebDAV. Finally, you can send your scans as a fax, but that costs extra—each page costs one “credit,” and you can buy credits individually or in packs of 10 (about $7) to 100 (about $35), with increasing volume discounts. Unlike some competing apps, SwiftScan doesn’t send any of your data to its own servers or perform OCR in the cloud, so it presents a minimal security risk. If you’re an iOS user, it also offers PDF encryption, allowing you to password-protect your files. One caveat: Although we think SwiftScan is great on both iOS and Android, the Android version lacks several options that iOS users enjoy. In addition to PDF encryption, other iOS-exclusive features include passcode and fingerprint app locks and in-app folders. SwiftScan’s new owners, Maple Media, tell us that they are working to bring feature parity to the Android app, but thus far they haven’t closed the gap much. If you prefer a one-time purchase instead of a monthly subscription, SwiftScan is also available as SwiftScan+ for $100 up front for iOS users, or $10 for Android users. On iOS that works out to less than three times the cost of a yearly SwiftScan subscription. People who buy SwiftScan+ at this higher one-time cost still get access to new features that are added in the future, so if you expect to use the app for more than three years, this purchase may be the more cost-effective route. Recently, global cybersecurity company Kapersky Lab revealed that the Android version of CamScanner—a popular competitor to our upgrade pick, SwiftScan—contained code from a malicious ad network that infected users’ devices with Trojan malware. This Trojan could serve to deploy other malware and potentially display other unwanted ads or even steal money from mobile accounts. CamScanner has since been removed from the Google Play Store. We tested the app back in 2018 and found it to be an extremely powerful scanning tool but ultimately dismissed it over broader concerns regarding its privacy and security policies. When we first tested the app, we spoke with David Templeton of the information security team of The New York Times and asked him to review CamScanner’s security policies. At the time, Templeton told us that of CamScanner and Scanbot (now called SwiftScan), he’d go with Scanbot. “In the InfoSec world, we prefer promises to be backed up by technology that would make it nigh impossible to break the promise,” he said. “Scanbot is making mostly verifiable promises, and CamScanner is requiring a lot of trust and faith.” In addition, if you take advantage of CamScanner’s best, most distinctive features (its included cloud storage and cloud OCR), the app transmits the data to its own servers, which the Shanghai-based company’s privacy policy states “can be located in either China or any other country or district in accordance with our service demands.” Although you can disable the cloud backups and use local OCR, that negates two of the most compelling reasons to use this app in the first place. So even if CamScanner returns to Google Play with a clean bill of health, we can’t recommend it. Uploading sensitive personal information to a server in China—even one whose owners claim to use 256-bit AES encryption—is too risky in our eyes. If you want the best possible OCR from a mobile app, consider ABBYY FineScanner (available for both Android and iOS). It’s exceedingly good—consistently more accurate than Adobe Scan, Microsoft Office Lens, and SwiftScan. But you pay a hefty price for that accuracy, and the app overall is limited in scanning anything other than text documents. Like SwiftScan, FineScanner is available in both subscription and up-front versions (in this case, regular and Pro). Functionally, they’re identical, but the regular version requires a monthly or yearly subscription while the Pro version is $60 up front with no recurring fee. Genius Scan (Android, iOS) is a very good, full-featured scanning app for iOS and Android, but we had issues with its OCR capability when we last tested it. The iOS version had a hard time with spaces, so if you extracted text from a PDF you ended up with a largely continuous string of characters, and the Android version of the app didn’t have OCR at all. However, the latest version of Genius Scan has added OCR for Android users, so we plan to test it again during our next major update. Smart Doc Scanner was our budget pick for Android in a previous version of this guide. It’s totally free (though you can pay to remove the few included ads), and it offers a well-rounded feature set, accurate auto-cropping, and diverse export options. Unfortunately, its OCR functionality is currently broken and has been for some time now; attempting to download OCR libraries returns a “server is not responding” error. Reviews on its Google Play Store page suggest that the developer has been unresponsive to inquiries, which leads us to believe the app may now be abandonware. For Android, we also tested Clear Scan but found that its user interface wasn’t nearly as polished as that of our picks, lacking automatic document recognition and capture, a batch-scanning mode, and the ability to OCR an entire document at once. That made it more difficult for us to get quality scans. For iOS, we tested Scanner Pro and liked its interface and performance with text documents, but we were disappointed with the results when scanning other types of media. We also checked out Prizmo, but its ugly, hard-to-work-with interface, its poor auto-cropping performance, its limited sharing options, and its unreliable filters turned us off. We considered but ultimately chose not to test apps such as Dropbox Business and Evernote Scannable because they require you to commit to costly subscriptions to much broader services in order to unlock full scanning functionality (including OCR). But if you’re already a paying subscriber, or if you don’t care about OCR, these scanning apps are definitely worth checking out. Apple Notes—included on all iOS devices—provides a simple scanning function with an easy-to-use cropping tool and four effective filters, but offers fewer features than our picks. For years it didn’t offer any OCR functionality, which made it an automatic dismissal for this guide. In iOS 13, Apple finally added OCR functionality to Notes, but it works a little differently than in other scanning apps. For one thing, it’s automatic: Notes recognizes all text in scanned images and makes it easily searchable from the iOS search bar, and since iOS Notes syncs to the Mac Notes app, you can also search your scans on your computer. But the OCR text can’t be exported as a text file or Word document; it’s only there to be indexed for search. That’s ultra-convenient when you just want to find the right scanned document, but not so useful if you actually need access to the raw text. We also dismissed several otherwise highly rated apps that didn’t offer OCR, came up short on features, were clones of other apps, had suspect security policies, or cost much more than other, comparable options: Fast Scanner (Android, iOS), Notebloc (Android, iOS), Tiny Scanner (Android, iOS), and TurboScan (Android, iOS).

        "body": "Jan 21, 2020 Coming up with a million-dollar mobile app idea could be challenging.  What if we share 53 inspiring mobile app ideas of the future with you? It would be cool, right? Also, we will show you 12 new techniques that will help you to come up with even more. Let’s get started!   Here are 53 innovative Android and iOS app ideas that you can take and start the development right away in 2020.  Some of these ideas are easy to implement even for beginners. As a starting point, you can use one of the open-source Felgo app examples .   The idea is to create a grocery shopping app that suggests shopping lists from the available budget. Items on the shopping list and store recommendations are suggested based on location, budget, date, and history of the purchases. Additionally, machine learning technology can be implemented based on purchase history and current input.     An Android and iOS app that lets you rate your day and look for patterns that affect your mood.  You would be able to add and evaluate activities, locations, events, that took place during the day. The idea is that the app will analyze your past activities and will look for patterns. Based on that, it will give you suggestions to improve your mood. Here is an example of an Android and iOS app from where you can get inspired. The app was developed in Felgo, a cross-platform app development tool.      A platform for single parents where they can share their interests, tips, experiences, and thoughts with each other.  This mobile app will match the parents based on the information they provide about themselves (e.g.: number of children, age of the children, location, interest, etc.).   This brand identifier app will allow users to learn more about a specific brand or product. By scanning the logo or tag of the item, the mobile app will list articles, information, and news about the manufacturer as well as about the product. In the case of clothing items, it will also tell the users whether it is authentic or not.     Many students struggle with understanding certain subjects in school.  This app facilitates the illustration of complex materials taught in classes such as Chemistry or Biology. By applying Augmented Reality technology, the app aims to help students visualize and better understand complex subjects. You can simply develop augmented reality apps using Felgo, a cross-platform app development framework.      Create your app for Android and iOS with the same source code and tools.  Get Felgo Apps Today! If you need help with your mobile app development, consult with Felgo’s team.   The application enables you to present your 3D models anywhere.  This app will allow you to import your 3D models into your iOS and Android mobiles, and illustrate them wherever you wish. The idea could be perfectly used for business project presentations as well as in many other fields.   A mobile food ordering app that enables customers to place their orders in advance. Once the order is placed, customers will be informed about the possible time for pick-up. Through this app, customers don’t have to deal with waiting in line as their order will be ready by the time they arrive at the restaurant.  Feel free to develop and experiment with this idea. You can simply develop the application template for both Android and iOS using the free cross-platform development tool. Once the template is ready, you can tailor the app to different restaurants’ needs.   Have you ever found yourself in a situation where while watching a movie, you just could not remember the name of the actor?  The same identification method could be used for this idea that the popular app, Shazam, was built on. You can simply take a picture of the celebrity you would like to obtain more information about. Once the picture is run through the app, it will provide you with the most useful information found on the internet.   Based on the above-mentioned method, not only songs or celebrities can be identified, but also movies, TV shows, perfumes, etc.      A virtual shopping app that can be used to create a shopping list at a specific store. It would also tell its users whether the selected product is available at the nearest store to their location. In case the items are out of stock, it would also give them a suggested list of where they can collect them.   Through this app, users can find contractors in any field. Users can also submit their requirements, compare prices, or read reviews about previous services. They can select their reliable providers based on availability, rating, location, and price.    Did you miss the lecture, conference, seminar, meeting or a class? Would you like to see the notes from the event, but cannot find anyone who would have it?  The idea behind this app is to create a platform where users can upload, share, or comment on new or existing notes about a particular topic.    The mobile app that helps you find free and paid parking spots at your location. The app could use GPS, webcams, location, parking data in real-time to find free and paid parking space nearby.   At least once in a lifetime, it happened to everyone that they forgot where they left their phone or which pocket they dropped their phone in.  This app could save time trying to go through all the places you might have left your belongings. This mobile app uses voice activation that turns on when you say the code word.   The mobile app makes socializing easier by helping you find people with similar interests nearby. You can choose topics of your interest, for example cinema, sports, movies, video games, books, etc., then swipe and find people in your area. The process of finding people could be similar to the Tinder app.   A restaurant reservation app that will let the users book a table at their favorite restaurant. Information, such as floor map, availability or the number of seats at the table, are provided upon booking.       Did you lose your keys in the carpark? Did you lose your jewelry in the fitting room? Do you know someone who has lost a small item before?  This app aims to connect the lost items with their original owner. Users can upload the items they found at a specific location so that these lost items can find their way back to their owners.   The idea is to create a mobile app that people can use to surprise their loved ones with gifts sent directly to their doorstep. Buyers can choose from many goods and services provided by local stores. The store owners can design their store profile as well. Buyers can choose from a great variety of merchandise and can also choose and design the packaging. Once the transaction is made, delivery personnel will pick the item up and deliver it right to the loved one’s hand.      A party and event finder app that collects all the available events from different platforms into one place from sources such as Facebook, Meetup.com, Couchsurfing, etc.  It'd give detailed information about the requirements, entry information, time, and venue.   A networking mobile application that connects you with people nearby to grab something to eat or drink. The app would allow users to connect based on interest, location, and availability. Then, users can start a conversation via direct invitation messages.   When was the last time you have nervously taken a sip from the milk container that has been open for days? This idea provides a solution to this problem. It is a tracking app that keeps track of the expiration dates of the food in your kitchen. Thanks to this app, users will no longer question whether the items are safe to eat or drink in their fridge or not.      A travel assistance app that will give its users suggestions of local attractions to visit, cuisines to taste, activities to do based on their interest at a particular location. Data would be retrieved from Tripadvisor and other travel sources, where locals and other travelers share their experiences.    A mobile travel app where users can list their interests and based on that it will show them places they shouldn’t visit or cuisines they shouldn’t try due to health reasons such as allergies, special diet, intolerance, etc. Feel free to develop this travel app idea by combining other relevant features that could be helpful for the traveler.   A digital receipt app that will collect all the transactions that you make into the app. It will reduce the overuse of the paper and will make it easier to track the costs and keep receipts.   A mall navigation app that displays a detailed map of the mall. This awesome app idea can surely increase customer satisfaction. It will not only make it easier to find the desirable stores, toilets or food courts but would also help the users to find the fastest route to their chosen destination. Sounds interesting? Check out Felgo’s demo map app and make a fortune by bringing this idea to life.    Supermarket checkout app that automatically scans the products on your mobile app while shopping. Upon checkout, the mobile app also makes the transaction via integrated e-payment. Get inspired with this innovative app idea from Amazon Go. You can simply develop this app idea and tailor the concept to the other markets. Here is a demo version of the Amazon Go, the world’s first self-service checkout mobile application.     A virtual interior design app that allows its users to take a photo of a place and design it virtually using augmented reality. This app could be used for businesses such as interior design agencies, furniture stores, or even school projects. This app will not only increase customer satisfaction but would also save a lot of time and effort to the business owners.     You can develop a similar interior designer app (for Android and iOS at the same time) using Felgo or its mobile app development service. Get Felgo Apps Today!   A tracking app that helps its users monitor their bills, subscriptions, and payments via sending automatic reminders about the next payment due date.      Do you have a package that you would like to mail but do not know which delivery service provides the best deal? This app idea provides a solution to this problem. It will suggest its users the best delivery companies with the best deals to send their package. The app would create the list based on reviews, location, weight, type, and size.   A social language exchange app where you can select the languages you would like to learn or practice, and will be matched with people sharing the same interests. Users can choose from study partners as well as teachers.      A social dining app that enables you to find people who would also like to get out of the house, socialize, or wine & dine in your area. To connect with others, users can send invitations to other users and once the invitation is accepted, they can roll and hang out with each other.    A taxi business management application that helps drivers to monitor their cash flow. Via this app, users can easily track their income, expenses, business supplies, and transactions all in one place.    The idea behind the social business networking app is that it allows its users to find team members for their specific projects in any desired field. This app idea creates a marketplace for professionals.   The idea behind this mobile app is to notify its users about the best route to take using public transportation. It would also alert the user when it is time to leave to avoid missing the bus, train, or even the plane. It would monitor traffic, delays, scheduled time of departure, and would also consider rush hour.    The idea behind this app is to combine all social media platforms, such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc., and use this app to stay up-to-date, post, follow, like, message, share, or comment at one place.    This is a marketplace for all wedding-related topics. Venues, musicians, flower shops, designers, etc. can advertise themselves in the marketplace. The future newly-weds can browse through the offers, read articles and reviews, and start conversations with other users.    This mobile application would create a platform for students where they can sell, buy, borrow, or lend used school supplies. The service can also be extended to other categories such as furniture, electronic devices, real estate, vehicles, etc. This application would not only save time but would also save money for students on both ends.   This tax invoicing business app will make entrepreneurs' lives easier. The app will calculate taxes that should be paid based on the user’s income and local law. It also might have an integrated feature for generating invoices.   Travel and tourism app that will show its users where, when, and what to do, eat, drink, visit, stay based on the feedback and recommendations from locals.    “What should I cook for dinner?” - a question that is asked way too often. This app idea provides a solution to this problem. The idea behind this application is that the users enter the ingredients they have in their kitchen. Then, the mobile app will give them a list of recipes they can use to make food from the available resources. This app could help its users to come up with some great cooking ideas that they mightn’t have done before.       AI-based Investment App that will do the market research for you, create a thorough analysis and present its finding right to your mobile phone. Based on the given information, you can decide whether you want to invest or not. It will also allow you to make transactions through the app.   This app lets its users create a career, business, life, or merchandise-based wish-list. If the user creates a career, life or business-related list, it will allow its users to select short-term or long-term goals. Once it is finalized, it will research online and suggest the best ways to achieve them. If it is a merchandise-based wish-list (e.g.: furniture, clothing, electronic devices, etc.), it will give you the best option where to find them based on your criteria.   An app that aims to help startup companies and entrepreneurs research common questions, issues, topics and hints and tips about their new business ideas. The app also provides a platform for finding clients, investors, and professionals to recruit.   Are you looking for someone to mow your lawn, walk the dog, feed your cat, or change your light bulb? This app idea provides a solution to these and many other problems. This is an app where users can find people in their neighborhood to do small work around the house, which takes only a couple of hours.   A smartphone app that notifies you about nearby deals on the mobile. You’ll get a notification when a store, based on your interest, is offering some kind of special deals, e.g. 50% off. The deals could be related to traveling, fitness, food, etc..   This is a grocery budget planner idea that helps people to monitor their spendings on, for instance, grocery shopping. This app will give them a better understanding of how much they consume and spend on groceries. The app will allow users to feed data about their purchases on a daily/weekly/monthly basis. Then the system would then give them analytics that would help them in future budget allocation.   With this app, users can create their own grocery shopping list and find a delivery service or even a person who can do the shopping on their behalf and get it delivered to their doorstep.      Did this idea catch your attention?  If so, kick-start your own mobile app with Felgo’s basic app then implement additional features, such as messaging and map, to your project.   Create an app that tracks the body weight and based on that, it gives suggestions on calorie intake, required amount and type of exercise to achieve your desirable body shape. You could include an exercise log in the app as well.   Create a localized mobile church app. where you enable members to take sermon notes, check the prayer list, listen to messages on the go, access small group material, engage with the real-time church news feed, give a donation, and much more. In the app, you can include calendar, sermons, etc. You can get inspired by this example.      This app would be developed to ensure that every shopper gets the lowest price possible. The app notifies the shopper about the available coupons. The coupons will automatically be applied upon payment, which will guarantee the lowest prices available. However, the shopper will have the option to select whether he or she would like to use the discount or not.    With this app, users can easily plan any event such as weddings, birthday parties, New Year’s Eve parties. It provides its users with all the necessary information, resources, and tips for their next event. Organizing an event with this app will reduce the invested stress and time. Via this app, users can also directly send a customized invitation to their guests.    The purpose of this localized app is to create a platform for people to donate clothing items, household items, food, school supplies, or any other things that they don’t need and find someone who does. Users can search for items based on type or location. The app would also allow users to auction their items for charitable causes.       Android and iOS app that automates social media engagement on Instagram. The idea is that the app can help you grow your Instagram followers and general engagement on your accounts. With the app, you can automatically follow, like, comment, DM, and engage with the people based on your account’s interests.     Start coming up with app ideas by identifying the frustrations that you have with the current way of doing things. Look at these problems, research and try to find apps that solve your actual or similar problems. In case you find such apps, try them out and see whether it solves your current frustrations, or not. Can’t find it? That might be a great start then. It is possible that others may have similar frustrations, which gives you a potential market.      This is a common approach to create new apps and businesses in general. It works well because it encourages you to look at things in simple terms. It’s much easier to fix a basic problem than to come up with a complex and completely new idea. if you understand the problem yourself, then you’re in a good position to fix it. Canvsly’s Android and iOS apps are great examples of this technique. The app was created by Amit Murumkar. He realized that there wasn’t enough space on his refrigerator for all of his child’s artwork. Some of it had to be removed over time to make space for new paintings and drawings but. But he didn’t have a good way to save the old artwork. He also felt frustrated because his own artwork was never saved. Then he thought about all the other parents that must have a similar issue. He found a problem he was having, realized that other people had the same problem and created a solution. You can read Canvsly’s full story here. The key to this technique is to be aware of pain-points in your life or the lives of others. If you or someone you know encounters the same issue regularly with no solution in sight, then you can be the one to fix it.   You might notice that popular paid mobile apps are followed by free alternatives. Similar applications that target the same audience by offering very similar value for free or at an affordable price. You can use a freemium business model for your free alternative to the popular paid mobile app. Firstly, focus on satisfying basic needs with your free alternative. After that, you can try to up-sell the product with pro-features. Have a close look at how some of the successful Android and iOS app companies use the freemium business model. To give a clear example, you might know about Spotify, which is a digital music, video streaming, and a podcast app that gives its users access to millions of songs. It’s basic functions, such as playing music, are free. But to get its pro functions, you have to upgrade to Spotify Premium.      Sometimes mobile applications come into our lives and seem to fix a problem we all have. But what if it doesn’t provide a complete solution or still has room for enhancement? In this case, it might be time to improve an existing idea by building upon it.       Take a look at what some of the big players in your industry are missing. Try to figure out how you can fill the gaps. Start by analyzing their products and try to identify what they do and don’t do well. Combine the discovered insights into the application development. Try to make the app stand out with a modern design that follows the latest technology. Many developers have gained positive results with this technique over the last few years. Whether it’s taking an app and giving it a better UI, or creating a lite version of an essential app, developers always seem to find a way to improve things. And you don’t need to confine yourself to the technological world either. Even traditional businesses are now being improved by app developers. Uber is a great example of this. Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp took a simple idea like the taxi and improved the service for end-users with their mobile app. Now they own a company worth over $60 billion. Their success speaks for itself. They didn’t have to invent anything new or convince people to do something they hadn’t done before. They provided people with a more streamlined service that gets them from A to B. Improving an existing idea is difficult but it has its advantages. A major advantage of this technique is that it’s easy for people to adopt. If you can explain your app by saying “It’s XYZ, but better!”, users will have an immediate picture of what your application can do. And once users see that you’ve improved an idea in a genuine way, it’s hard for them to go back to doing things the old way.   When trying to come up with mobile application ideas, try to identify industries that are popular but lack recent innovations. Augment applied this concept well for their business by creating an augmented reality app for real-estate salesmen. The application helps them better present and sell their real estate projects and could also be a great substitute for boring brochures.      You can apply a similar mobile app idea for different industries and fields. You can create similar augmented reality apps for Android and iPhone at the same time in Felgo’s cross-platform development tool .   Get Felgo Apps Today!   Try to predict the upcoming future. Successful mobile applications are created by innovators who don’t stick with the old technologies or methods. They try to identify trends that will be successful in the future. You can do this by analyzing recent trending mobile applications. Simply take a look at the top 100 Android and iOS applications. Moreover, you can have a look at Product Hunt where you can discover the latest mobile apps, websites, technology products, and trending industries. If you’re good at noticing trends or predicting what’s going to be popular in a few months, then conducting user research is a great way to find inspiration.   Try to come up with an app development idea based on your target users’ needs. Start doing it by conducting early user research. There’s no better way than interviewing your potential users. Try to find out the following: By answering these questions, you will have a better understanding of your potential competitors, the actual needs of the targeted users, and the way you should shape the development of the minimum viable product (MVP).      Here is a good example of how Brian Wong came up with Kiip, an in-app mobile advertising platform that uses moments to create meaningful customer interactions and generate highly targeted, custom audiences. He analyzed potential user behaviors in the most basic way possible. While traveling by plane, he checked the backseat screens of other passengers to see what they were doing. He noticed that the majority of the passengers were using their devices to play mobile games. All the passengers were highly engaged, but Wong noticed that on-screen ads offered little value to users. He decided that mobile gamers should be able to earn real-life rewards for their engagement and so Kiip was born.      Wong’s user analysis focused on a small cross-section of mobile users but he was able to identify a trend nonetheless. Your user research could be as simple as asking 5 friends what they use their phone for most or a poll on your favorite social media site. The important thing is to gather solid information from reliable sources. What’s more, try to build up an email list of potential users. You can start experimenting with one of these email campaigns. Building up an email list will help you to: All this will help you to get the product market fit before launching the product itself.   Try to understand people’s repetitive processes and create a solution that would ease or speed up their daily routines. “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.” — Henry Ford   Coming up with the mobile application idea doesn’t mean that you have to focus on inventing a new product or service. In fact, focus on identifying what solutions people use to solve certain repetitive processes. Observe and learn more about those processes. Try to identify what solutions do they use for the complete process. Think about what they lack in those solutions and how you can improve them.   Why not localizing globally successful mobile applications? There is nothing wrong with that. You can get awesome mobile app ideas by looking at popular international applications. Study them and tailor them to your market if needed. For example, you can create something similar for the local audience like meditation or training apps. Don’t clone exactly, but take the good aspects from those applications and tailor them to your market. Instead of reinventing the wheel, try to think about how you can improve the existing wheel.   The more you do and the more experience you gain, the more capability you have to come up with new ideas by connecting dots from your past experiences. Leonardo da Vinci’s greatest breakthroughs came from connecting the unconnected. In particular, the insights gained by bringing different perspectives together. He defined the innovation as connecting the unconnected. Bill Gates read books on different subjects . He believes in the power of finding useful things by chance to come up with new ideas. In a speech from 2005, Steve Jobs captured the spirit of innovation in three sentences: “You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life”        Brainstorming has a bad reputation within certain circles because when it is done incorrectly, it can be a big waste of time. Once you get it right, you’ll even surprise yourself with what you are capable of coming up with. Here are a few quick tips to improve your brainstorming session!  When brainstorming, it’s a good idea to keep a certain topic in mind. This helps you to create ideas within a certain context. A visual prompt is an effective way to frame the context you’re trying to work in. Even having a photo of an object can be a useful anchor for your ideas.     This technique may seem out of the ordinary at first, but there’s a clear method to this approach. You start off by trying to think of the worst ideas possible. Write them down and then try to turn these terrible ideas into good ones. It’s a basic approach, and you may not always succeed but if you come up with one good idea then you’ve had a productive brainstorming session.  One of the problems we all face when coming up with ideas is that we work within our own set of assumptions. You can only begin to think outside the box when you challenge these assumptions. To start off with, think about the kind of app you want to make. Then ask yourself, why you want to make this type of app, why will it be successful, and why you’re the right person to make it. This type of brainstorming helps you scrutinize potential ideas. It helps you discover stumbling blocks before you encounter them in real life. By imagining these stumbling blocks, you consider ways to overcome them or avoid them completely.   You’ve got a mobile app idea? Write it down. Notebook is a great tool for organizing ideas and but it has also been proven that writing down ideas helps you to remember them better as well. If you’re the type of person that has 100 ideas a day, keeping track of everything in your head can be difficult. How to make an app when you consider that you’ll need to prioritize these ideas at some point, it becomes obvious that keeping a notebook is your best option.      Many of history’s great thinkers and inventors kept notebooks with them. The most famous was Leonardo Da Vinci. His notebooks are artwork themselves. They contain designs for futuristic machinery, mathematical equations as well as his thoughts. It’s clear that there was a way for Da Vinci to keep track of his ideas. If it worked for one of the greatest geniuses of all time, it might help you come up with an app idea as well.      Taking breaks might sound unusual but the stories of people coming up with brilliant ideas in the shower or while taking a walk are true. This technique has a neuroscience-based explanation as well. When you slow down from awakeness mode, the brain moves to its most creative mode called, on Theta state. In other words, you’re starting to daydream. In the Theta state, the brain often generates ideas when you’re not forcing it to.   Source Our personal tip for slowing down is to take a 10 minutes break or use the 4–7–8 breathing technique. After your mind slows down, ask yourself questions that help you come up with the solutions.      Hopefully, you’ve got a better understanding of how to approach the idea generation process itself from the second part of the article.

Choosing a budgeting app can seem like a small decision when compared to other personal finance decisions. But the right budgeting app can make a large difference in your personal financial life. When selecting a budgeting app, be sure to consider what your needs and goals are first. The right budgeting app can provide you helpful insights and data into your expenses and savings. But before that happens, identifying what your financial goals are first can help you curtail your search for the right budgeting app for you. Outside of your goals, here are a few features to consider before you commit yourself to a budgeting app: To create this list, Forbes Advisor analyzed 15 budgeting apps. We ranked each budgeting app on 18 data points within the categories of consumer ratings, costs associated with the app, security and encryption of consumers’ data, desktop availability and the ability to share the app with someone else. The following is the weighting assigned to each category: Budgeting apps with a higher overall rating relative to its number of reviews ranked higher on our list, as did those that are completely free. We also prioritized mobile apps with advanced security features, like biometric authentication, multifactor authentication and encryption. Apps that allow the ability to connect an unlimited number of accounts moved toward the top of our list, as did apps that also have a website version and allow for sharing with family or friends. There are several excellent free budgeting apps to choose from here to service your needs. However, the best free budgeting app for you is the one that will best serve your personal financial goals. To find the right app for you, don’t hesitate to download a few and test them out for yourself. Budgeting apps are a great tool to help ensure you’re living your budget, not just planning one. They can provide great insights into your spending habits, where your money goes and where you can make improvements. While many budgeting apps claim to have user-friendly interfaces, each person has different likes and preferences. It is difficult to say which budgeting app is easiest to use, but all eight of these highly ranked budgeting apps are designed to provide a positive user experience. The best monthly budgeting app is the one that best suits your personal finances. Each of the apps recommended above has features to help you avoid common budgeting mistakes and that can apply to a variety of money-managing styles and financial goals. Budgeting is a process that begins with identifying your financial goals and savings (and spending) priorities. When you know how much money is going out and coming in, you’re better prepared to handle both the expected and unexpected financial challenges life brings.   Your budgeting habits also matter: The clearer your money mindset—and your spending and saving habits—the better your budgeting and investing efforts can serve your goals. If you have money habits you need to improve, the right app can help. Brett Holzhauer is a former banking and personal finance reporter for Forbes Advisor.

        "body": "Even leaders lose some time. To reach the top position in the mobile development market and not lose it, you need to keep in mind the importance of Time and Trends. Want to know more? Have a glance at our mobile app trends report Contents: Playing the Game of Tech, you either win or… you lose 400 billion dollars. “It really is winner-take-all”, - confesses Bill Gates talking about his greatest mistake ever. And even if it seems to you that such exceptional entrepreneurs as Gates don’t slip up, we have a surprise for you. Microsoft is still one of the most valuable companies in the world; however, the company’s co-founder and one of the richest people on this planet says that Microsoft had enough potential to become the main Apple’s competitor on mobile OS market.  Due to distractions caused by the antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft and lost focus, the company has missed the once-in-a-lifetime chance. Google became a main Apple’s rival, Android outran Windows Mobile dartingly, and Microsoft had lost hundreds of billions of dollars. The leading companies are not always inspiring examples, and the story above proves that. Sometimes they tell us about hidden pitfalls they accidentally got into; sometimes they share hints on how not to screw up. This story induced us to define 2 cornerstones of the mobile app development business success. If you plan to launch a cutting-edge programming tool, there are 2 things you need to keep in mind: Today, we are going to talk about the most powerful things that can lift your business to the desired position in the market. We are going to highlight the brightest mobile development trends. Let us introduce the top 7 future trends that have already started to revolutionize businesses. In 2018, smartphone users worldwide downloaded 194 billion apps. As for 2019, we expect even a higher number: considering tendencies and rising statistics, there is no chance that the number of downloads could have decreased. These facts recall quite contradictory feelings: on the one hand, this type of “addiction” creates great opportunities for sales and business development: building a mobile app, companies worldwide get direct access to potential customers’ wallets. On the other hand, that’s not so easy: there are around 2.6 million apps on Google Play Market and 2.2 million apps on Apple's App Store. The users’ choice is limitless, and they need to have obvious reasons to choose exactly your app. But here’s a tip for you: let them follow the mobile app trends! To win at least a small piece of potential customer’s time, to attract attention and get closer to users, you should be aware of mobile development trends and decide on how to integrate it into your perfect app. So here are the trends:  Now we take a closer look at each of them. You'll find helpful insights on how to implement these trends for various types of businesses at the end of each block.  Native and cross-platform mobile application development topics recall much disputes: Java/Kotlin or Swift/Objective C for native approach or React Native and cross-browsability? Or Ionic would be more suitable? And what about Cordova? Software engineers have devoted so much attention to this! Now, there is something more to discuss. Flutter, one of the fascinating mobile app trends in 2021, changes the rules of the game. Its stable version was released at the end of October 2018, and a bit later, it joined top software repositories on GitHub.  What a start, what a potential! But what is Flutter? Let’s shed some light on it. Flutter is a software development kit (SDK) built by Google. This is a complete solution with a framework, widgets, and tools that enable building a mobile app for the two most popular mobile platforms of our times: Android and iOS. Besides, it is expected to become a key tool for app development for Fuchsia - a new OS announced by Google. Flutter is a key to the dreamed smooth and simple cross-platform app construction. No apps to be developed separately: Flutter provides one codebase that is a great fit for all mobile platforms. These are the reasons it has become one of the mobile app trends for the next year. We can say, React Native has a powerful competitor now. Flutter is: And Flutter apps look and work just great! “Flutter was the right choice for us,” – says Jorge Coca, software developer at BMW. Let’s have a glance at Flutter’s main advantages that let us add it to the app trends: Flutter allows building apps in a much faster and comfortable way. Thanks to the hot reload, a developer can edit the code and view changes in the app right away. This feature simplifies debugging as well. Besides, due to a single codebase, the tests are written only once. Flutter has the ability to change the entire development process. That is so great that allows designers and developers to sit side by side and implement changes like “replace the icon” or “speed up the animation” in a blink of an eye. And keep in mind that Flutter widgets help to create awesome designs. Thanks to the above-mentioned specifics and many other technical details which make app development process fast and seamless, Flutter will help to launch an MVP and attract investors quickly. This is far not the end. Additionally, this year on Google I/O, Flutter Web preview was demonstrated. So who knows, maybe next year, it would be not only a mobile development trend but also a cool thing in the web industry. What it means for your business: All the above-mentioned facts will bring great benefits to your brand-new mobile app. No matter what industry you plan to break into, application development trends will come in handy. And currently, Flutter is the one able to provide you with all the needed features swiftly, make a development process as smooth as possible and launch an MVP to attract investment and start raising your business.  Don’t miss the potential of the new Google framework. Start enjoying the benefits of Flutter right away The most influential players on a mobile industry stage turn their heads towards helping the users to set boundaries between digital and real-time, focus on specific tasks instead of distracting on apps and achieve well-being goals to improve their lives in general. Digital wellbeing is a brand-new way to catch users’ attention and make them trust your brand. It's not about consuming all user's free time anymore. It's about giving him a chance to spend his time effectively  We all know that feeling when you open your Facebook app just to check if your friend’s having a birthday tomorrow and end up an hour later scrolling your news feed with no defined intention. Mobile apps are greedy time eaters, and people devote a tremendous amount of time to their devices. At first sight, it seems like an advantage for your business; but lately, we’ve noticed this tendency to drift in an opposite direction. It all started with Google Pixel’s users: they were first to try convenient functionality for digital habits observation. Later on, all other smartphones with Android Q OS have got Digital Wellbeing integrations. Team Apple has got an opportunity to view digital habits, too. With iOS 12, features like Screentime Dashboard, App Limits, Downtime etc are available.  So, what is it about? Now, the users of the latest smartphones can: And what about the users who haven't upgraded to the freshest OS version? They should have access to these features as well. And this is exactly where you can show how much you care about your app users.  What it means for your business: Follow the app trends and extend your app’s functionality with screen time tracking, focus mode, customized notifications, etc. For now, digital well-being features are available on the latest Android and iOS versions only. Thus, you can level up your app by enabling users with previous OS versions installed to try a new experience and manage their digital time in a better way: Following such mobile app industry trends is your chance to appeal to customers’ trust. Let's discuss the potential of your mobile application. Mobile usage and user experience have changed greatly since buttons have started to dismiss. We are already used to the fact that the interaction between a smartphone and its user looks like hand movements on the touch screen (like a tap, double-tap, press, pinch, rotate, etc), as well as shaking and tilting. Soon, there’ll be no need to touch the screen as the new application trends emerge. These days, innovative gesture controls techniques emerge to make mobile usage even more intuitive and convenient. This is what you should take into account when deciding to build a new revolutionary app. Modern smart devices are powered with radar-based motion control technology. For example, using Galaxy Note 10, you can perform various actions like controlling the device’s camera by just waving with a stylus.  On Google Pixel 4, the more advanced motion sense technology called Soli is implemented. Users can turn on a Motion Sense mode and pick up or decline a call, snooze the alarm, switch to the Do Not Disturb mode and so much more by just waving to Soli.  Companies all over the world start to launch revolutionary motion gestures recognition engines and platforms, implement the principles in their apps and appeal to customers’ wishes in such a way. These features turn to application development trends. What it means for your business: In 2021, putting buttons on your app’s user interface isn’t enough: you should improve your app with a touchless experience. No matter what app you would like to produce, this technology may help you to become a leader on the market. Let users perform different actions by just waving or snapping fingers in front of the screen: These cutting-edge application trends have the potential to change UX completely. And you can become one of the successful pioneers. The launch of the iPhone X had brought us many updates, among which Face ID was quite a massive one. Apple has gone beyond the technologies we’ve used to and started to analyze the human face 3D model with its contours and emotions. Android has followed the lead, and Face Authentication now appears in beta. Microsoft works on this technology, too. They try to build and train a camera that will determine if it’s a real person trying to use Face ID or its just an image in front of a camera.  Although Face ID had some troubles in China, face recognition is still the trend plenty of businesses strive to implement. And here’s why that’s a true trend: Facial recognition technology is a great method to protect your personal data and your device. If you are the only one who may unlock a device or access important information, the risk of fraud decreases swiftly. MasterCard has already launched a “selfie pay” feature as an alternative to traditional authentication. This is a quick way to checkout without having to wait for time-consuming identity verification. On Android Q devices, face authentication for payment works, too. Users now can choose if they want to employ face recognition to unlock the device, sign-in an app, use it for payment confirmation, etc. Shopping is getting faster and more secure with face recognition payments. As we’ve mentioned above, UX has changed greatly since there are no buttons to push on your phone. Along with gestures, facial recognition is a great way to quickly and seamlessly enter an app and make the needed action. Besides, the login procedure can be time-consuming and even problematic: they say, 37% of people forget passwords at least once a week. With facial recognition features, such issues will disappear. What it means for your business: Generation Z prefers and trusts to biometric tech; thus, facial recognition implemented in your app is one of the app trends as well as a great way to reach out to the most active mobile users. Depending on your business specifics, you can integrate facial recognition techniques to: Asking Siri about the weather next weekend has become a part of our day. The same can be told about Google Assistant or Amazon’s Alexa: virtual assistants are rapidly spreading all over the smart devices. A mobile virtual assistant gives its digital hand to a user for a variety of tasks: Not only ordinary users enjoy the impact of virtual assistants on their daily lives; corporations employ it effectively, too. For example, HDFC bank has launched EVA AI-based assistant in 2017. Since then, it has addressed more than 3 million queries with 0.4 sec average response time. The assistant answers banking related questions 24/7, explores bank products’ features and benefits to highlight them to customers, helps to pay bills and even books bus tickets! That’s a great result for a bank and its clients: significant experience improvement contributes to reputation and income. Implementing app trends, the bank has succeeded. What it means for your business: In a world where AI-powered chatbots have such a potential and make such a difference on UX, you as an entrepreneur need to consider it for your mobile app, too. Provide support or give a piece of advice; solve specific tasks and simplify users’ lives. In the Internet of Things world, our devices, vehicles, homes, etc. will be united in one huge network with all the required services and products provided instantly. Amazon Go demonstrates how the adoption of IoT may change the shopping experience. Nest proves that smart devices, sensors, cameras, and high-quality software can help users manage their real estate objects remotely. The number of IoT devices grows rapidly, and the tendency won’t change in the future. You as a business owner shouldn’t ignore this fact: the IoT application development trends adoption can bring you to the desired position in the market. Instant response to queries, Real-time video streaming for IoT world demands, self-driving cars or autonomous drones, real-time communication between vehicles, etc – these are the features users will appreciate and pay for. What it means for your business: The revolution that IoT world creates conditions for prosperous business growth. 84% of enterprises plan to finish their IoT implementations within 2 years. And for your mobile app, it would be a great push towards success if you’ll make it a component of the IoT system.  If you build a mobile app in 2021, integration with IoT devices may become your once-in-a-lifetime chance to add your name to the industry trendsetters list. “One-fits-all” sounds good. But for the 2021 business, it won’t work. Mobile app industry trends related to personalization will fuel your app’s success and highlight it among other apps.  Learning from the leaders, we can draw your attention to the SoundCloud app, the world’s largest streaming platform. The tool analyzes listeners’ previous activity and preferences to customize the delivered content and improve the overall experience. With the help of in-depth data analytics and AI algorithms, they offer a song a user will most probably like. What it means for your business: You can appeal to your app’s users in a better way employing the cutting-edge trend. Depending on your app’s type, the following scenarios can take place: The number of examples is unlimited but the concept is always the same: it is not just one of the mobile app industry trends but also a profitable tactic for your mobile app growth. The mobile industry changes so fast that it’s a great challenge to keep an eye on all the cutting-edge trends and join the innovations right on time.

        "title": "The 25 Best Board-Game Mobile Apps to Play Right Now",
        "link": "https://www.vulture.com/article/best-board-game-apps.html",
        "desc": "The best board-game app of 2019 (which was a banner year for new releases) was over a year in development, and does what the best adaptations do: It makes the original game better.",
        "body": " Things you buy through our links may earn New York a commission. Our current golden age of tabletop gaming has also led to a similar surge in mobile apps that adapt board games to tablets and phones, with new ones arriving almost every week and some games even premiering in digital form at the same time they show up on store shelves. I’ve tried more than 50 such apps, all of which are based on games you can actually buy in stores; these are the best of the bunch. Unless otherwise noted, these are all available on iOS and Android, with some on Steam as well. The list does not include iOS apps that stopped working in the June 2017 “app-ocalypse,” when Apple required developers to update their apps for 64-bit support, such as Samurai or Through the Desert; or apps that still work but are no longer available for purchase, like Battleline, Stone Age, or Caylus. With new apps coming all the time, we’ll update this list regularly to reflect any new titles that merit inclusion here. I wasn’t even aware of this Reiner Knizia game before Dire Wolf announced the app last year. It’s a sort of spiritual successor to his 1997 game Tigris & Euphrates, one of the all-time classics of area control. In both games, you score by growing your “kingdoms” in four different colors, but at game-end each player’s lowest score of those four is compared to the other players’ lowest scores. Where Tigris had players placing square tiles on a map, creating kingdoms of adjacent tiles that go to “war” when they’re connected, Yellow & Yangtze uses hexagonal tiles that allow for more connections between groups. It also introduces a fifth color of kingdoms, gold, that can be used to boost your score in any of the four other areas. Dire Wolf’s apps all look great, with bright colors and snazzy animations, and this is no exception. One of the all-time great Euro games, Puerto Rico is a high-strategy game with very little randomness or luck involved. You’re building out a colony by planting crops, constructing buildings, shipping goods either for money or points, and hiring colonists represented by … (squinting) little brown tokens. (That’s true in the physical game as well.) It’s a classic “engine builder,” where you set things up in your space to generate stuff each round, mostly trade goods you can ship for points, which is the optimal strategy unless everyone else is doing it, too. Only available on iOS. A beautiful rendition of one of designer Martin Wallace’s famed economic games, most of which also involve trains because he really likes trains (and who doesn’t?), Brass is set in the industrial-revolution era in England and asks players to build factories so that they can manufacture and ship cotton, iron, and coal for points — but you have to borrow enough to keep your business going so that eventually you can turn a profit. The original version didn’t have a strong enough AI component, but the developers added a harder option last year. Another Wallace title, this one a little easier to understand than Brass but not as appealing to look at. Steam has players competing to build rail lines on any of various maps — one standard map is New England — to connect cities and towns and then ship various colored cubes across their rail lines. You get money each time a good travels along one of your tracks, regardless of who’s shipping it. There’s almost no randomness or luck involved here, making this a great game if you enjoyed that operations-research class you took in business school. One of my favorite complex Eurogames, The Castles of Burgundy gives you a lot of options, and a lot of ways to score points, but it’s a bit of a bear to set up and the original game had some unfortunate color choices on its small hexagonal pieces that made them hard to distinguish. This app version uses graphics from the newest edition, and has solid AI players that can navigate the myriad choices and strategies available to players, only lacking in the spite that actual humans can show (there are some times when blocking an opponent is the right strategy). This is a game I rarely get to the table in my house, so playing on the app is often a good way to get my fix. Designer Antoine Bauza loves Japanese themes in his games, with gorgeous artwork to match, with the app version of Tokaido bringing the same graphics, while adding some cute animations to make the board feel less static. The real Tōkaidō, or East Sea Road, was a major thoroughfare in Japan during the Edo period, traveled by foot and connecting Kyoto to what is now Tokyo. Players in Tokaido travel along the board, stopping wherever they wish, with each stop allowing them to do something that eventually leads to points — collecting artifacts, donating to the temple, collecting portions of artworks, or buying meals at the inns along the route. Although there are several different ways to rack up points, usually you just want to stop everywhere you can, both to gain the benefits and because you can block another player from stopping there. Terraforming Mars is one of the most popular and best-reviewed complex strategy games of all time, and bringing it to digital had to be a significant undertaking given the difficulty of creating competent AI players for the app. Based on the popular trilogy of Mars novels by Kim Stanley Robinson, Terraforming Mars has players competing to build complex engines of cards that will help generate six different resources they can use to buy and play more cards. Players will also terraform the board, placing greenery and water hex tiles — as well as the occasional city tile — on the planet, further boosting the planet’s temperature, oxygen, and water, driving the game toward the end conditions. There’s a lot going on here, all the better to have the app to handle the accounting and the cleanup for you. This is my current favorite solo app, based on a physical game that plays two to four with a solo mode. The app doesn’t offer multiplayer and it’s designed for you to play this solo in one sitting … but it’s super fast and so addictive that you aren’t likely to stop mid-game or to play just once. It’s a dice-roller: You’ll roll your set of six dice 18 times across six rounds, selecting and removing one die after each roll to fill in a spot on your scoresheet, which has five areas matching the colors of five of the dice. (The sixth die, the white, is wild and can be used on any color.) Filling in certain squares unlocks bonuses, including the all-powerful “plus one” ability that lets you select and score an additional die. The goal is to get the highest score you can; anything over 200 is good, and 300 is Hall of Fame material. A clever two-player game from Uwe Rosenberg, usually known for heavier games that involve gathering wood and raising farm animals and take two hours just to set up, Patchwork is a bit like competitive Tetris. Players take oddly shaped fabrics from a rondel that limits choices on each turn, placing them on their nine-by-nine boards and sometimes gaining buttons, the game’s currency, to allow them to buy bigger fabric pieces or gain more choices from the board. The graphics in the app don’t correspond to the physical game’s imagery, though, and are frankly a little too cutesy. It’s like the title says: This is a map game of area control and takes just a few minutes to play. Everyone starts in the same space on the board with three-foot soldiers and gains a certain number of moves each turn by taking a card that grants goods as well as either movement points, military units, or the right to build a city. Scoring at the end is based on control of continents and collections of goods, with the biggest bonuses coming if you collect a lot of any one good. It’s fast and the AI players are good. Another game with beautiful artwork and animations, Lanterns is a tile-placement game with a clever scoring twist: Every time you place a square lantern tile, you gain a token of the color facing you … and each opponent gets a token of the color facing him or her. You gain a second token if you matched the edge of the tile you placed to the edge it’s touching on the board. You trade in tokens in sets for points, but the point bonuses for these — one of each of the seven colors, four of a kind, or three pair — decrease over the course of the game. It’s over quick, and since you can’t control your tile draws, your strategy is really turn by turn. Raiders of the North Sea, a worker-placement game from the prolific designer Shem Phillips, is the perfect game for a digital adaptation: It’s a fantastic game with a fair amount of setup and a lot of pieces. In Raiders, players place meeples in the port town at the bottom of the board to gain supplies and hire workers so they can outfit their longships with raiding parties to go pillage the outposts and fortresses across the top two-thirds of the map. The app brings in the outstanding, cartoonish artwork from the physical game as well. Dire Wolf Digital’s next port, the stellar dice-drafting game Sagrada, is already in Early Access on Steam and would make this list if it were fully released right now. The tabletop game on which this is based involves a mad scramble for parts to trick out your spaceships, a process well-replicated, even when playing against AI players who, in theory, could just cheat and take all the good bits. What truly separates Galaxy Trucker from so many other adaptations is the best narrative campaign on any board-game app. This wasn’t just thrown together — someone wrote it like a short graphic novel you’ll play your way through many, many games over. It’s brilliant and makes the game so much more addictive. My all-time favorite two-player game got a digital version last year with an unexpected twist: a campaign mode that comprises all kinds of variants to the base game’s rules. In Jaipur, each player has a hand of up to seven cards and tries to collect sets of the six goods shown on the cards, each of which has its own value. You can only take cards from the five shown in the “market” on the table. There are also camel cards, which you can use to take multiple cards at once; a popular tactic is to set up a move where you replace all of the goods cards with camels from your stack, so that your opponent has no choice but to take all five camel cards and give you a chance to choose from five fresh cards from the deck. The campaign mode tweaks various rules, like reducing the hand size to five or changing the card values so that they’re all the same. The popular, quick-to-learn game Splendor was an instant hit on its release in 2014, and the app version followed soon afterward, finally gaining online play as an option last year. Splendor players collect tokens they can use to buy any of the 12 gem cards on the table, arranged in three rows from cheapest to most expensive. The more costly a card, the more points it’s likely to be worth. Collecting certain combinations of cards — three each of three specific colors, for example — may get you a Noble tile, worth another three points. The first player to 15 points triggers the last round, and then whoever has the most points wins. The best board-game app of 2019 (which was a banner year for new releases) was over a year in development, and does what the best adaptations do: It makes the original game better. Evolution has players competing to create species and arm them with Trait cards that make them better foragers, or turn them into predators, or give them stronger defenses against other players’ carnivorous species. The physical game moves kind of slowly between turns, but it’s much faster in digital form because the app does the work for you of figuring out which species can “eat” where — and the animations when species do eat are clever. One of the most successful worker-placement games in history and the reason we have since been inundated with games that pretend that farming is fun and easy, Agricola is really about feeding your family: You grow crops, raise animals, bake bread, build out your house, and maybe learn an occupation or two. It’s actually more enjoyable than it sounds because it’s a sort of puzzle of how to balance gaining points with the requirement that every few turns you turn in enough food to feed your family members. The huge decks of cards with occupations and additions called minor improvements gives the game replay value as well. Le Havre, a heavier game that combines elements of Agricola and Caylus, also has an app version from Codito. Pandemic is a cooperative game, so playing it on mobile means pass-and-play or playing it solo and handling all the roles yourself. There are four diseases spreading around the world and you have to find cures while slowing their progress across the map. If eight outbreaks occur, or you run out of cards in the player deck, you lose; if you cure all four before that, you win. You can customize the difficulty level as you’d like, including Heroic and Legendary modes if you enjoy losing. The On the Brink expansion is available as an in-app purchase, adding new player roles and event cards, plus a new challenge. There are also app versions of two similar games from the same designer, Forbidden Island and Forbidden Desert; the latter is especially good as a solo endeavor that remains difficult, but moves faster than Pandemic. I don’t love the Race for the Galaxy board game because I think the produce or consume x2 strategy is dominant (if you don’t know what that means, don’t worry), but man is this app version a thing to behold. Not only are the AI players good but the developers managed to cram a lot of information onto even the smaller screens of phones, allowing you to zoom in on any card easily enough to read the icons, making opponents’ actions clear, and giving you plenty of chances to undo certain moves if you screw up. On a tablet, it’s just about perfect. And I can confirm that I have beaten AI players using a different strategy by going full military … but it wasn’t easy. Here’s a game I haven’t played on tabletop because it’s so long and fairly heavy, but the app is stunning, featuring by far the best tutorial I’ve seen. It even has a legitimately funny joke buried within it. Through the Ages is a 4X (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) style game played out with cards, where you try to build a civilization, complete wonders for points, beat opponents with your military, improve your government, and ensure that your workers don’t riot. There is a lot going on in this game, and too much accounting for my tastes, but the app takes care of that stuff for you, so you can focus just on playing the game itself. It also has built-in warnings if your workers are going to riot or you’re going to lose resources before the next turn. The false 3-D perspective also helps them cram a lot of buildings onto your screen without crowding it. Games against AI players take 20-plus minutes, more than anything else on this list, but there’s very little downtime involved. Istanbul was a really thoroughly designed app right out of the box: It has strong AI players and allows you to fully customize the game’s variable board. Istanbul is a route-finding game that manages not to feel like too much of a route-finding game: You move your merchant around the four-by-four board, with each space allowing you to perform some specific function, like collecting goods, selling them for coins, upgrading your caravan, or trading goods or coins for rubies, which is the actual goal of the game. The first player to get five rubies (six, if you’re playing with just two players) wins. It’s clear, moves quickly, and the AI players are impressive, especially with how well they adapt to randomized boards. Acram’s port of Charterstone, a competitive legacy game for up to six players, should be released shortly as well. Days of Wonder, which is now part of the Asmodee family, put out two of the earliest successful board-game apps with Small World and Ticket to Ride. Both feature outstanding graphics, easy-to-follow play on tablets or phones, and competent AI opponents. They also worked particularly well for pass-and-play, with Small World — later updated and dubbed Small World 2 — including a feature that allows two players to face each other across a table and play on a tablet without having to exchange or rotate it. Small World is an area control map where there just isn’t enough room on the map for all of the players. You pick a race, grab some territories, and then put your race into “decline,” so you can pick a brand-new race and start all over again. It’s bloody good fun for the whole family — and the app takes care of the one small hassle of the physical game, tallying up points each turn. Carcassonne was one of my top apps of the last decade because the iOS port, from Coding Monkeys, was the best of breed from the day it was released. Its license for the game expired at the beginning of March, however, and it’s no longer available to purchase; there is currently no iOS port of this game, although I assume one is coming soon. In the meantime, you can play Asmodee Digital’s version on Android devices and Steam. This version offers players an isometric view instead, which gives the tiles some texture, although you can switch to top-down if you prefer that. The iOS app is cleaner to look at, while the Asmodee version offers more animations to give it more of the feel of a video game. There are four AI opponents: a “focused” AI, a builder, an aggressive opponent, and a “conqueror.” There are six in-app purchases available, including what I think is the best expansion for the board game itself, Traders & Builders. This was the original model for how to build a great board-game app, complete with an active player community, and it remains one of the best, thanks to an overhaul a few years ago and regular releases of expansions. The base game is my go-to recommendation for readers who ask for a game that they can play with their kids because the rules are simple, the scoring is easy to understand, and QED train games are awesome. The app’s tutorial is good, the animations and graphics are excellent, and the user interface is intuitive. (You’d be surprised how often board-game apps screw that last part up.) The Ticket to Ride app offers Europe, Switzerland, Nordic countries, England, Germany, Asia, India, and Pennsylvania maps as expansion options, as well as new card sets like the 1910 and 1912 sets for the U.S. There’s also a version for younger players, Ticket to Ride First Journey, as a separate app, which is also quite good. The 7 Wonders app appeared in November after years of anticipation, delays, and testing … and it was worth the wait. 7 Wonders itself is one of the best board games we’ve seen because it condenses the city-building theme into a consistent 30-minute playing time. Each player gets a hand of seven cards per round, plays one, and then passes the remaining cards to the next player, who selects one from his or her hand and passes the remainder around … so that everyone plays six cards per round (discarding one), but the cards you get to choose from keep changing as the hands move around the table. You do this three times, playing 18 cards, building a little engine that gives you the resources and coins you’ll need to play more buildings or complete your Wonder. There are lots of ways to score, so part of the game is finding a path to points that your opponents aren’t following. Moves are simultaneous, so solo games fly by on the app, although it can be tough to follow what all opponents are doing, AI or real, if you’re playing against more than three other players. The developer just added the Leaders expansion as a $1.99 in-app purchase. It’s a tremendous game that finally got the app it deserved.

        "body": "The top money transfer apps for sending money between friends, family and small businesses FOLLOW SELECT  Every day, millions of people around the globe have to figure out how to pay for the things they need. Whether you’re an independent contractor filing an invoice, friends splitting the check or a family looking to divide up household expenses, electronic payments have become the norm for paying for almost anything in a fast, secure way simply by picking up your smart phone. “I’ll Venmo you,” has nearly replaced the phrase, “Do you take a check?” But of course, not every business likes emojis alongside their invoices, and that’s where apps like PayPal — which has a slightly more sophisticated invoicing set-up — come in. Factors like cost, transfer speed and international capabilities all come into play when choosing the best method for transferring digital cash. Ahead, Select reviewed the best five apps for sending money to friends, family and even some small businesses. (Read our methodology for more information on how we choose the best money-sending apps.) No charge for sending money from a linked bank account, debit card or your Venmo account; a 3% fee for sending money using a linked credit card Instant transfer to Venmo balance; 1 to 3 busines days for direct deposit (free) or instant transfer to your bank account for 1% fee ($10 max) Links to popular apps; social features to interact with your friends’ payments (including stickers and emojis); Venmo debit and credit cards Yes, bank and credit cards Only available in the U.S. and only compatible with U.S.-based bank accounts and phone numbers; compatible with iOS & Android Multi-factor authentication when signing in; QR code readers to make sure you link to the correct user account before you send money See our methodology, terms apply. Free (but check with your bank to ensure it doesn’t charge an additional fee) Instant: transactions typically occur in minutes when the recipient’s email address or U.S. mobile number is already enrolled with Zelle No need to download an extra app; Zelle is already included with most mobile banking apps Yes, to U.S. bank accounts iOS and Android; must have U.S. bank account linked to an email address or compatible U.S. phone number The Zelle app uses authentication and monitoring features to make your payments more secure See our methodology, terms apply. Free to download the app; $0 to make purchases using a bank account or your PayPal balance; $0 to transfer money to friends and family; 2.9% + $0.30 transaction fee to pay business/contractor invoices 1 business day or instant transfer with 1% fee PayPal Credit lets qualifying users pay for purchases over $99 over six months interest-free Yes, bank accounts and credit cards iOS and Android; available in more than 200 countries and regions Two-step authentication, data encryption, email confirmations for every transaction See our methodology, terms apply. Free to download and use basic services 1 to 3 business days or instant cash-out deposits for a 1.5% fee (25 cent minimum) App allows users to invest money in individual stocks as well as buy and sell bitcoin Yes, bank accounts and credit cards iOS or Androis Data encryption and fraud detection technology; unique, one-time login codes, two-factor authentication See our methodology, terms apply. Free to download; transfer costs vary by country and amount (economy are often $0, express transfers start at $3.99) 3 to 5 business days Convenient delivery options, including sending money directly to trusted banks, cash pick-up locations, mobile wallets or via home delivery Yes, links to debit cards, credit cards and bank accounts iOS and Android; for U.S. users sending to other countries only Secure server with data encryption; two-factor authentication See our methodology, terms apply. The best money transfer apps are free to download, but costs vary depending on how you use them. Most services offer free bank transfers at a standard speed of 1 to 3 business days, but charge fees if you want to pay with a credit card and/or speed up the delivery to your bank account. International money transfers vary based on the country’s exchange rates and bank fees, but you may still be able to choose a standard or economy delivery versus a more expensive express delivery. Be sure to check fees before assuming that all money transfers are free. Money apps are arguably safer than cash since most require you to create an account with a password and two-factor login methods (such as sending verification codes) to verify your identity and the person you are sending money to. Likewise, using a money app is safer than writing a check because it will not expose your bank account number and routing number to the person who receives it. By signing up for a money transfer app, you are, in essence, making it possible for anyone to send you a digital payment without viewing any of your secure account information, just your user ID or email address/phone number. And unlike cash, digital payments cannot be lost. Because digital money apps allow you to send money to anyone with an account, the one caveat is that it can be easy to send money to the wrong person if you’re not careful. Some apps offer additional protections, like QR-code scanning, text or email verification, unique user IDs and profile pictures to ensure the right person is on the receiving end of your payment. To determine the best money-sending apps, Select analyzed over a dozen options offered by the top companies in this market and narrowed down our ranking by only including apps that meet the following criteria: In addition to these baseline requirements, some of the above apps offer additional standout features like social sharing, investing capabilities and flexible payment options (such as the ability to pay over time). We noted these features with a brief explanation, and you can learn more by visiting the respective app’s website. © 2021 SELECT | All rights reserved.

Want a chunk of this huge revenue pie but finding it difficult to come up with creative & simple app ideas to stand out from the crowd? If yes, then you are at the right place. Take inspiration from 70 mobile app ideas and turn your dream into reality. So, it is a Saturday evening, and you’re all set for your first date. The only problem is that you don’t know anything about the cuisines she’s into. Upon meeting her, you ask her what type of food she likes. ‘I mostly prefer Chinese.’ But sadly, there is no Chinese restaurant near your home. And the one that you know requires one to reserve a table in advance. Undoubtedly, Google Assistant can book hotel reservations, too, but that won’t give you the personalized experience that you’ll get from an app. Choosing a specific dining place in advance is a one-in-a-million experience. If app developers or you can develop an app that enables a customer to not only reserve tables but also select a specific table and order the meal in advance, then this is an best app idea that can make you filthy rich. You might have seen apps that can suggest locations that you can visit for vacation. But what about the places that you should not visit. An app that takes your interests, phobias, and dislikes into account and suggests all the places that you should not go. We all want to travel, but nobody wants to go to a place that they wouldn’t enjoy because of some things. So why don’t you come up with an app that will help your audience sort out the places that they should not visit at any cost. There are unlimited apps to sell goods or junk items. But what if you are not willing to sell anything. Instead, you want to exchange something. Just take the goods that you are bored with and create an app that can exchange them with goods that other people have. Is the food you are about to eat rotten or fresh? Sure, you can take a bite and find out, but is there a guarantee that you won’t end up like Snow White? Of course not. If you and your buddy have some AI/Machine Learning skills, then one of the mobile app ideas that can earn you some money is a food inspector app. What you can do is train your AI to identify food that has gone rotten. Just click the photo of the food that you are about to have and let the app do the rest. AI of the app will analyze the quality of the food, based-upon multiple data points. And based on the data collected from the picture, the app will tell whether the food is fresh or gone bad. You met a beautiful girl back in 2009. You were friends with her for some time then she moved to another country, and you lost the connection. Out of sheer luck, you met this gorgeous girl again in 2019. Will you be able to remember her name? If not, that would be disappointing. But how about an app that will maintain a database of all the people you met? You’ll be able to find out when and where you two met and other personal details about her right from this app. How cool will that be? It was a long day, and you have no energy to do anything when you enter your home. But right there on your letterbox, there is a letter from your mom.

And I guess it will be an overnight hit app. Out of town, away from family, having limited items to cook? This app idea is for everyone who is away from their home and don’t have anyone to cook for them.

And if you like any recipe you can save it and share it with your friends. How many times have you bought a product and later on realized that the product is not original?

And how many of those thoughts are negative? Well, not anyone. For every negative thought that you think you will tap in the app and $1 will be charged from your credit card.

Are you someone who forgets the birthday of your friends and family? Welcome to the club. One of the most necessary mobile app ideas that will help you to store the dates of occasions of your friends and family.

These days it is impossible to find a tenant online. This is where a mobile app will help. An app that can bridge the gap between the tenant and the landlord, how amazing will that be?

How about an app that can manage your budget and ping you whenever you try to cross a certain threshold. The good thing is that this is a common problem that most people face every day, so if you create a budget management app, it will not only be right for you; it will be an instant hit among people who are serious about their budget. The app can also suggest how to save money? Men tend to forget more than women. When was the last time your girlfriend forgot your birthday? Or when was the last time you remembered to throw a party at the last moment? For men, these moments come quite often. This is where an app can help you out. An app idea – a party app that can take all your strain and plan everything on its own. From catering to inviting the guest, everything will be done on call and you’ll receive notifications on the pending tasks that need to be done. Don’t know much about pets? Well, many people like you love their pets but don’t know how to groom the pet. One of the simple app ideas is to create an app that can nurture your pet. Whether it is the training of the pet or playing with the pet, the app can take a good take of your pet while you finish your office work or home chores. Calling all the shopaholics out there. A life-changing app idea can save you precious time while a shopper on your behalf will pick the prescription, buy groceries, and not even complain about anything. An app that involves helping people in purchasing stuff while you are in your office and the personal shopper will deliver it right to your doorstep. Whether you want a new dress for your friend’s wedding or buy an anniversary gift for your spouse, let the app handle it for you. For most people shifting home is gut-wrenching, which is why they look for services that can load and unload their stuff in a short time. One of the most demanding apps for 2022 will be to find a truckloader in your respective area. When you hit the search button, it will pick your location and suggest all the trickloaders near you. You can interact with the truckloader and tell all about how many pieces you have and what vehicle you will need to carry all the pieces in one go. This can be one of the best mobile app ideas for 2022. Everyone wants to feel safe on the roads. In this app, you’ll be able to alert the nearest police patrol car about suspicious activity around you. The app will hold all the data from criminals and alert the police with an alert button that would inform the police regarding your location via GPS. How many times you’ve come across a situation in which you need a pen and paper to write something down? I suppose countless times. A simple app idea that will read text on paper and save it for future reference. If you can, it is also possible that you convert the text and store it in text format. They say man plans, God laughs. Do you have an important meeting but don’t know will it badly or not? How about an app that can predict a disaster right before it happens.

Symptom tracker apps can help you identify symptoms of a particular disease early so you can act quickly to minimize the damage. Want to transform some of these mobile app ideas into fully functional mobile apps, get in touch with our mobile app development company in Toronto. Ever since the pandemic started, we have been constantly bombarded with reminders to wash our hands frequently for at least 20 seconds, not to touch our faces in public and to practice social distancing? However, how often do you remember to follow through? What if you could build an app that sends constant reminders to help people practice COVID-19 hygiene and avoid getting sick. The new app can be trained with a simple machine-learning algorithm to recognize images of people touching their faces and to send out warning when it detects the users doing the same. Not to mention, the app can detect other mobile devices in your vicinity and can ping you if you are standing too close to someone. Similarly, users can instruct the app on how often they would like to be reminded to wash their hands, and the app will do it. An app like this can do wonders in curbing the spread of the virus. It may seem like COVID-19 restrictions are easing up right and left but travel can still be uncertain. Wouldn’t we all feel easier with an app that offers the latest COVID-19 travel updates and specific testing requirements for your destination, including places where tourists’ restrictions are currently in force? Before making travel plans, users can input their destination, and receive detailed information on entry regulations (including required forms, testing, quarantine measures, and more), lockdown status, virus containment, and even recent pandemic-related news in that area. If you are travelling for recreational purposes, you can even check the expected size of crowds on public transportation and at attractions, as well as everything to open restaurants/attractions options to hotel availability. The app can also provide specific instructions for the country regarding entry, masks and testing and quarantine requirements, based on your vaccinated status and country of origin. These days, your vaccination card is your go-to pass no matter where you want to be or where you want to go. You may be asked to show your pass to travel abroad, or at events, restaurants, hotels and venues asking for proof of your COVID-19 status. The best way to store your vaccination status without losing or damaging your printed card is to keep it on your phone. While you can snap a picture of your vaccination card, you wouldn’t want to look through photo albums and tap through multiple screens before you’re able to show it to a bouncer at your local bar, would you? Why not create an app to facilitate people to carry their digital Covid vaccination certificate? The App allows users to download the Covid vaccination certificate issued through their respective government websites and save it on the phone. The verifiable digital certificate offers proof of COVID-19 vaccination should it be needed. What if there was an Airbnb for our luggage? Have you ever had to check out of the hotel but still had plenty of time to explore a few places till your flight? Life would be so much easier if we could check an app and find the nearest storage facility to drop off our luggage for some time. You can start the service locally to facilitate tourists in your area and then move globally. Whether you are relocating or sprucing up your home for the spring, you will come across a lot of things that you don’t need any more or can’t accommodate at your new abode. Not to mention, the pandemic and ensuing lockdowns have made it really unsafe to host a garage sale. Instead of throwing those belongings into the trash, be it furniture, clothes, utensils, or gadgets, why not give them to people who may need it. Why don’t you create an app that allows homeowners to give away their stuff online? In the midst of endless lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, most institutes are still sticking to remote learning. This makes it impossible for students to sit and study together. Imagine how much more complex group projects and assignments become in the face of such difficult times. A great app idea at this time is to create a platform with virtual study rooms where the students can exchange their notes, work on projects simultaneously, or talk about the lessons they have learned. It can be a great collaborative platform for students and encourage group learning. It can be quite a hassle if you find yourself without an umbrella on a rainy day. While there are many weather apps out there, it will be really helpful to find an app that sends Realtime whether updates to users so that precautions can be taken accordingly. This app can also be used to alert users about impending storms, floods, etc. and provide information about help centers, routes, safety manuals, and more. 2022 is almost upon us and it’s going to be the year of crypto. The time is ripe to jump on the bandwagon and create a cryptocurrency exchange application for trading or the exchange of crypto assets. The app would also help users send virtual gift solutions to their friends and families. However, if you are ready to build an app of such magnitude, make sure that the app is safeguarded and follows all the laws and regulations. Homeowners don’t have the time neither the skills to perform repair work at home and often need to call someone in for the smallest tasks. However, what if you are new to the area or your go-to plumber or electrician is unavailable? Why not build an app that connects homeowners with technical personnel to get the small odd jobs done; be it fixing a leaky faucet, giving your home a new coat of paint, changing light bulbs, repairing floors and roofs, or getting your AC fixed.     I am an experienced digital marketing strategist & blogger. The best weather apps allow you to check whether the sun is shining, wind is howling, or you need to take an umbrella with you for grocery shopping. Gone are the days when you had to wait for the end of evening news to... Did you know how much time people spent on apps every day?

Codebrew Labs was an excellent partner to work with on the Safecity Mobile app which crowdsources sexual violence in public spaces. The team was very attuned to our needs, worked in tandem with our team, we're open to suggestions and did a quality job whilst adhering to timelines. The feedback we have received is that the app is really well designed and easy to use. I would highly recommend CodeBrew Labs. We hired Code Brew about six years ago to help rebuild every aspect of an emergency app we created. The staff was friendly, courteous, and very professional. He provided expertise beyond the terms of the agreement as well being available just about whenever. We continue to work together on several other projects. Overall Code Brew gave us what we wanted, albeit slightly over budget. They stayed on schedule most of the time, and were thorough in their responses... The work was well done and I would potentially use them again and refer them. I’ve been in business for 45 years and very seldom do I come across people like them who actually do what they say they’re going to do. What impressed me was that Code Brew was able to do stuff that a lot of other companies couldn’t do. I was thinking maybe this app wasn’t possible to build, but when I brought it to them, they knew how to do it, and they did a good job. We could not have asked for a better partner than the Code Brew Labs team. We truly feel like they are part of the LokaTrain team and family instead of seeing them as a service provider. They have shown tremendous passion and know how the trust and relationship we have built will last for the next 10, 20, 30 years.

To get the best possible experience please use the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge to view this website. Updated: May 12, 2020, 8:29am An exceptional mobile app from your car insurance company can make all the difference when you need it most. If you get pulled over, you may want to show your auto insurance ID card from an app, rather than digging for it in your glove compartment. If you have an insurance claim, you want the ease of submitting it digitally. There are many potential conveniences with a good mobile app. We evaluated the features of mobile apps from top auto insurance companies to find the best ones.  Allstate: Allstate’s mobile app provides important functions for going paperless and making claims. It also has helpful functions such as Allstate’s Digital Locker for making a home inventory—an essential list if you ever have a disaster such as a home fire or tornado. Allstate’s Escape Route helps you create a virtual escape route to use during a fire, so your family can practice and have a plan handy. A gas finder helps you locate the cheapest gas nearby. Geico: Geico’s mobile app covers all the bases for going paperless and making claims. It also has a variety of features to help keep you happy on the road, such as a gas finder, parking locator and notifications for vehicle recalls and service reminders. Geico Explore uses augmented reality to help you discover your surroundings by holding up your phone while the app pinpoints restaurants, attractions and where your car is parked.    Allstate 95 Geico 95 American Family 90 Nationwide 90 Progressive 90 State Farm 90 USAA 90 Liberty Mutual 85 Amica 80 Farmers 80 The Hartford 80 Shelter 75 COUNTRY 70 MetLife Auto 45 Erie Insurance 0 Mercury Insurance 0 National General 0 NJM 0 Travelers 0 Related: Best Car Insurance Companies of 2021 Ability to access auto insurance ID cards from the app, 20% of score: Getting pulled over by the police can be stressful. You don’t need the hassle of trying to find an insurance ID card or, even worse, getting ticketed for not being able to produce your proof of insurance. Having an insurance ID accessible from your phone is crucial. Ability to view your insurance policies from the app, 20% of score: You may desire to read your insurance policies only when you absolutely have to. But in those instances, like when you have a problem, you need easy access to your latest policy. A mobile app with access to policies is important in times of trouble. Ability to file claims with the app, 15% of score: Mobile apps should offer chances to save time and go paperless. Being able to make a claim through an app is far better than having to call it in. Track claim status, 10% of score: If you file a claim, you want to be able to know its status easily and any time. Being able to track a claim’s status can save you frustration during the claims process. Upload photos and/or documents for claims, 10% of score: Insurance has historically been mired in paperwork. Accelerating your claim digitally is a time-saver, so being able to upload claim documents lets you move on to other things. Summon roadside assistance, 5% of score: What’s the good of buying roadside assistance insurance if you can’t find help when you’re on the side of the road? A good mobile app can send you help right away. Find auto repair shops, 5% of score: If you’ve been in a car accident, you don’t want to have to worry about finding a reputable mechanic or collision repair facility. A good mobile app will point you in the right direction. Car accident checklist, 5% of score: It’s hard to keep your wits about you at the scene of a car accident, especially when you’re trying to determine injuries and damage. A car accident checklist will help you collect all the information you need at the scene, so you have a better chance of making a successful insurance claim later. Extras, 10% of score: Some auto insurers have put extra thought into their mobile apps, providing additional helpful features even if they’re not directly related to your vehicle or auto insurance. We scored each company on nine metrics based on the availability of features in their main mobile apps: accessing auto insurance ID cards, viewing policies, filing claims, tracking the status of claims, uploading photos/documents for claims, getting roadside assistance, finding repair shops, accessing a car accident checklist, and extras (which varied by insurer). Insurance companies with a score of 0 had either no mobile app or an app that wrapped around their website. Some insurers have other mobile apps in addition to their main app. I’m the Insurance Analyst for Forbes Advisor. I’ve been writing about insurance for consumers for more than 20 years. Insurance intersects with many parts of our lives, yet it’s tough to untangle, and wrong choices can make a financial mess. I’m here to help you make sense of it. I’m especially interested in how data is affecting the price you pay for all insurance types."

        "body": "A blog about app User Experience by UXCam “Without data, you're just another person with an opinion.” — W. Edwards Deming Choosing the best mobile analytics tool for your app can easily be overwhelming. After all, there are so many vendors on the market already, and more are being added every day! According to a Harvard Business Review study, researchers found that “businesses that integrate multiple sources of customer and marketing data significantly outperform other companies.” They also had dramatically higher total shareholder returns. It’s time to compare the best mobile app analytics tools and platforms on the market today. We did extensive research to find the 11 best tools for you to consider. Contents “Build, improve, grow.” Platform: iOS / Android / Unity Price: Free / Paid What it does: Firebase doesn’t just focus on analyzing your app; it also provides the infrastructure to build it. A strong advantage of this mobile analytics tool is that multiple features like analytics, crash reporting, hosting, and A/B tests all come in one product. The pricing is fair for apps with low traffic, but it can get expensive for established apps. Firebase is a tool that you’ll find in the SDK stack of many popular apps. “Deliver the perfect app experience.” Platform: iOS / Android / React Native / Flutter / Xamarin / Unity Price: Free trial / Pricing upon request What it does: UXCam enables app professionals to improve their app’s KPIs through a deep understanding of user behavior. UXCam offers benefits that other app analytic tools don’t: 1. Uncover the true causes of friction and frustration. Heatmaps show you where users tap and which elements they ignore. 2. Get more context on where and why users drop out. Find out how users behave during your funnel. 3. Replicate and reduce crashes. Save valuable developer time by replicating every crash in under 30 seconds. 4. Understand the complete user journey with video session replays. UXCam shows you the big picture and gradually drills the analysis down to individual user journeys. Customers have reported higher conversion and retention rates since they started using UXCam. You can start a risk-free trial here. Integrating UXCam into your mobile app takes 5 minutes and 2 lines of code. “Product analytics for product people.” Platform: iOS / Android / Web Price: Free / Paid (starts at $25/month for 1K users) What it does: Mixpanel tracks user interactions and allows you to build custom reports. This app analytics tool lets you evaluate user actions by segmenting them and by creating funnels.

It should be noted that Flurry is free because they may share your data — anonymously — with third parties. “Analytics for modern product teams.” Platform: iOS / Android Price: Free / Paid (starts at $2K/month) Free up to 10 million user actions per month. If your app exceeds that, you must go for an annual contract that starts at $2K/month on the lowest plan. What it does: Amplitude is a robust quantitative analytics tool. Its features and use cases are comparable to those of Mixpanel. “360° web and mobile analytics.” Platform: iOS / Android / Web Price: Free / Paid What it does: Countly provides an overall analytics picture for web and mobile. It offers a real-time, open-source mobile analytics application that can be hosted on your own servers. “For the ultimate iOS developer.” Platform: iOS / tvOS Price: Free What it does: Apple App Analytics is included with the Apple Developer Program membership and doesn’t require any implementation. Although with limited capabilities, it’s a decent mobile app analytics tool. It should be paired with another more advanced one. “Know why they come to your apps. Know why they stay. And know how to keep them.” Platform: iOS / Android Price: Paid What it does: Adobe Analytics gives you the tools you need to understand your users.

While protecting companies from an average of over 30% fraudulent mobile ad traffic is a big feat, eliminating ad fraud also has data and analytics implications that cannot be ignored. You get access to clean data by eliminating the fake installs, the fraudulent clicks, and the simulated in-app purchases and registrations. It’s important to remember that, while each system is different, it’s crucial to view the entirety of the customer journey while using your product. Analytics tools are a big part of the mobile SDK ecosystem: This graphic shows the big picture of the SDK ecosystem. Another tip for ensuring nothing is missed: Integrate both qualitative and quantitative mobile analytics into your analytics stack. This concludes the list. We’ll update this article regularly to catch up with the fast-moving analytics world. P.S. The fastest-growing apps in the app store use UXCam. FAQ: A mobile app analytics tool is a software that helps you to monitor your app’s performance. Usually, these tools require the installation of an SDK (Software Development Kit) on your app. You need to install the SDK of your analytics vendor on your app. This requires adding a short piece of code. Make sure that you install both quantitative and qualitative analytics. Without app analytics, you won’t know which features of your app are performing well and which are not. You’ll miss hidden opportunities and bottlenecks. UX, marketing & product nerd. Coffee enthusiast. Working at UXCam. Leave me comments if you have any!"

        "desc": "Now let's take a look at the list of top mobile ad networks of 2020 we've compiled for app developers and mobile business owners to find the right one to work with. To compile this list we researched the major players in the mobile advertising field, included companies that offer the wide range of ad formats and targeting options, as well ...",
        "body": " Updated: November 26, 2021  The Mobile advertising industry landscape consists of two major parts – Supply, that is presented by publishers and a SSP (stands for Supply Side Platform) that aggregates mobile inventory across hundreds of thousands of publishers and Demand, that is presented by a DSP (stands for Demand Side Platform) that allows advertisers to place mobile ads in publishers desktop or mobile inventory. Utilize AdColony’s industry expertise and proprietary machine learning algorithm to find users, appearing in pre-vetted inventory and paying only for success. A Mobile Ad Network function is to serve a middle point between these two ends of the value chain, moving inventory across both supply and demand, either directly or via reselling or re-broking of inventory. On some occasions, companies register with an ad network as both advertiser and publisher. Such double registration allows these companies to account traffic it generates as a publisher to cover fees it needs to pay for traffic it acquires as an advertiser. Ad networks involvement into advertiser – publisher dynamics isn’t always limited with mobile traffic delivery and providing performance stats, sometimes, when advertisers budget is high, ad networks get involved into ad creatives production. For instance, in a case of video ads, that today run supreme of digital advertising efficiency, ad networks can substantially improve advertiser’s ad campaign efficiency and increase its revenue. The pioneer in the mobile ad networks space was AdMob , that really took off after its acquisition in 2009 by Google, Inc. Over the course of more than 10 years since, the advertising networks space has grown with a small number of top tier companies have been controlling the market. Apart from AdMob by Google, which later become part of the Google Ads ad platform, these are Facebook, Twitter and, in a smaller degree, Snapchat and Pinterest. The paramount advantage that allows these companies to occupy the top tier of the mobile ad market is how much data they can accumulate on their registered users and leverage this data for ad campaigns precise targeting. Now, the recent newcomers Reddit and TikTok present an interesting case. The former has one of the most diverse online communities on the planet to reach and monetize and the latter is the brand new China-based social media that is like no other US counterpart. Both are worth of advertisers attention as an alternatives (or extra options) to Facebook and Google. The next tier, that has survived competition with aforementioned companies and continues to compete for mobile advertisers budgets, consists of Applovin, UnityAds, ironSource and Vungle. Compared with the Google and Facebook duopoly, these four have much less data points for a mobile user profile and therefore can not target mobile ads as precise as the top tier companies. To partly negate this limitation and help advertisers achieve their goals, these companies provide account managers to handle low-level ad campaigns management. One of the most profound shifts in the mobile ad industry is that mobile apps have become the major inventory for ads to be displayed in, replacing traditional mobile web. This shift has even coined a new term – in app advertising. There is a simple reason behind this transition – multiple researches demonstrate that people spend most of the time with mobile devices, using apps, not browsing web sites as they used to. With the number of mobile apps that continues to increase exponentially, mobile in app advertisements have a potential to replace mobile web ads completely. Today all highest paying mobile ad networks are laser focused on mobile as the fastest growing digital advertising sector. As mobile advertising industry continues to grow, it becomes more and more apparent that moving all operations into programmatic area is the only way to go. This is how you can accommodate greater and greater advertising volumes, allow ever increasing number of advertisers to manage their ad campaigns efficiently and mobile publishers to maximize their inventory monetization. The downside of the programmatic approach is that it produces lower engagement rates, introduces advertisers to risk of a fraud, generally it’s less relevant compared to manual ad campaigns and can even be harmful for brands in cases when their ads occasionally being placed on websites next to questionable content. Continue the trend on advertising automation, Artificial Intelligence algorithms are praised as the way to tackle multiple challenges that digital advertising faces. In fact, AI is the technology that many industries embrace to handle big data volumes to search for patterns and valuable insights to increase its efficiency. For mobile advertising it is also a brand new way to better fight off mobile ad fraud. Speaking of mobile ad fraud, according to Jupiter research this year it’s the advertisers fate to loose $42 billion because of a fraud. There are two kinds of digital ad fraud – technical and compliance one. The first one covers all sorts of technical ways to trick ad network into considering fake advertising events as genuine ones and the second covers multiple tactics to break the rules established on a specific advertising platform. Examples of technical fraud are ad stacking, attribution fraud, faked postbacks. The compliance fraud has to do with viewability, cases of placing ads in areas it rarely can be seen but still reported as seen, tricking users into clicking on ads, re-brokering ad offers from one publisher to another and more. Now, before we’ll start profiling top mobile ad networks, let’s define several characteristics to describe a mobile ad network.  All mobile ad networks provide users with several types of business models to run ad campaigns with. There are 5 major types – CPM, CPC, CPI, CPA and CPV. With CPM (cost-per-mile) type, an advertiser is charged each time her or his ads are shown 1,000 times (so-called ‘a mile’). It’s the best business model for publishers, because it allows to make money every time an ad was displayed. If they have a stable predictable traffic, it allows publishers to forecast their revenue. The down side is that they may loose some extra revenue, if their app or website audience is really interested in a product or service they advertise. For that case CPC model would allow them to make more money. With CPC (cost-per-click) model an advertiser is charged for each click made on her or his mobile ads. This model works better for advertisers, because it allows them to pay only for instances when an interest to their product or service is explicit (their ads were clicked) and, as mentioned above, in some cases may work for publishers as well. For a publisher this model always presents a certain risk of him serving lots of ad impressions for free. CPI (cost-per-instal) model implies that advertisers are charged only when a click on their ads resulted into an actual mobile app install. It’s a specific case of a more generic CPC business model. Cost-per-install price has become one of the most important metrics for mobile app marketers to measure and keep track of, because essentially it represents a price they pay to acquire customers and hence it should be factor into ROI calculations. CPA (cost-per-action) type is more advanced version of CPI, when an advertiser is charged for specific action (in-app sale, subscription, form submit, sign up and more) users take inside an app that is advertised on a mobile ad network. This type of a business model presents more opportunities for publishers to monetize their inventory on one hand and more options for advertisers to grow their business on the other. And finally CPV (cost-per-view) type is applicable to mobile ad networks that provide advertisers with video ad campaigns. With this model, advertisers are charged for each instance their video mobile ad was viewed. With the current pace of a video advertising growth, this model becomes more and more popular.  There are 5 major formats supported by top mobile ad networks – interstitial, banner ads, native ads, video ads and offer wall. A full screen ads that cover the interface of their host application. This mobile ad format is most frequently used to display an ad between different app screens and it’s quite often displayed between different levels in a mobile game app. A classical static or animated image ad, which is placed inside an app’s interface. Such ad may advertise a third party product, other digital or physical goods, as well as an option to expand an app’s functionality. Either a banner image or video ad that matches the form and function of the app interface it’s displayed in. The core concept of native ads to mimic an app’s interface to be least intrusive compared to other ad formats. It is an ad unit within a mobile app that provides end users with lots of offers to engage with. The most frequent use case is mobile games, where offerwalls may either advertise third party games or a series of games from the same game developer. Video ads consist of a short, usually up-to 60 seconds, video clip to advertise products and services. This mobile ad format is most often used within media apps. There are two major types of video ads – in-stream and out-stream. With in-stream type, video ads are displayed full-screen before, after and within video content that is streamed inside an app. With out-stream type video ads are displayed on a web page, displayed inside a mobile app. An advertising campaign performance data reporting is one of the key components that is crucial for its success. This information is provided by mobile ad networks to advertisers via an online dashboard. It includes data on such parameters of ads performance as number of impressions, clicks, installs, video ad views, platform, country, ad format and so on. There are number of parameters that allow to narrow down a mobile ad campaign reach to a specific audience. These parameters are called targeting options, there are a number of such options but the majors are the following: It allows to narrow down an ad campaign within a specific country or region. It enables mobile marketers to advertise a product or service that is relevant only within a specific region. It allows to show ads on specific models of mobile devices only. This type of targeting lets advertisers to display ads on devices with a specific screen size and other hardware requirements, which allows to avoid a mobile ad experience degradation. With this option, it’s possible to show ads only to mobile users, who are served by a specific mobile carrier. It presents advertisers an opportunity to display ads to mobile users, those mobile carrier provides a better mobile signal reception in a specific area. it allows to show ads on mobile devices running specific operating system or even particular versions of OS. It gives advertisers a benefit of displaying ads to mobile users on devices that are best to display those ads software wise. By applying this targeting option, it’s possible to show mobile ads on mobile devices when they are connected to the Internet either via Wifi or 3G/LTE connection. mobile ad network that collect mobile users data and build their profile allows to narrow down an ad campaign on an audience segment with specific interests only. This option allows to narrow down an ad campaign to mobile users of a particular gender. Naturally, just like with any kind of advertising such targeting is aimed to market goods specifically to females and males. One of the best sources to check a particular mobile ad network performance is the AppsFlyer semi-annual Performance Index. Below you can see the snippet from the H1, 2019 edition and it covers media sources performance for both gaming and non-gaming apps for iOS and Android operating system. In the table, Volume Ranking based on the total number of non-fraudulent installs each was attributed for, Power Ranking based on the normalized and combined number of non-fraudulent installs, the number of apps running with each media source and the weighted retention score.

It’s compiled based on the data Singular derived from more than 550+ mobile media sources, 2.2 billion installs with matching ROI, $6.3 billion in advertising spend. The index factors in a number of metrics, such as mobile user retention, revenue per install and what is the most important – the cost to drive app users engagement.

        "body": "EDUCBA By Priya Pedamkar  Choice of mobile app Programming Language is the first and most important step in mobile app development, and it largely depends upon the OS that you are going to work with, as different Operating Systems support different mobile app programming languages. For instance, whereas C and Objective C would be used for iOS apps. HTML5 is ideal for both as. Your choice of language would make or break the success of your app. This article will guide you through the basic Mobile App Programming Language, which will help you create your very own apps! Start Your Free Software Development Course Web development, programming languages, Software testing & others The app development world is lucrative for not only those who wish to earn through it but also for those who believe their ideas to be pioneering. If you wish to get into the world of app development, all you need is a computer and a basic grasp of the mobile app programming languages that make up the apps. However, choosing a language can often be confusing, especially for individuals lacking information about the programming world. There are a large number of mobile app programming languages that Mobile developers use for app development. Whether you are new to Mobile App Programming Language or a pro interested in learning a new skill, these eight languages are ideal to start with. Follow this 5-step approach before making a choice on the language to be used: pitfalls. Often, Java, JavaScript, and Enterprise Java Beans are confused with being the same languages. In reality, however, these three are different software development systems, all having “Java” in their names. While JavaScript is a scripting language used in Web browser apps and is helpful in enhancing attributes of a Web page, Java Beans, on the other hand, is a reusable software component that can be manipulated visually in a builder tool.” But when we talk about the mobile app programming language, it is Java that is being discussed. Java, developed at Sun Microsystems, is now co-owned by Oracle. It is among the most commonly used mobile app programming languages, and hence a major chunk of developers are skilled in Java. Java is a platform-independent object-oriented program development language. That makes it extremely practical as one can use it across various operating systems. But most of all, it is used with Google’s Android mobile OS. It is most suitable in cases where Android is the main platform. It is also used where a codebase that is shared across various platforms needs to be developed. For iOS, however, Java cannot be used as an initial development language. Java, being a compiled language, has the advantage of running, both in a browser as well as in a device without a browser. Due to this flexibility, the coding can be easily re-used, and software updation also becomes easy. This makes it an excellent performer. USPs Best Suited For: C++ is an object-oriented mobile app programming language that is one of the oldest and most widely used languages worldwide. It is used for designing apps on almost all platforms like Android iOS, Windows, and Mac OS X operating system platforms. It is the primary language that propels the mobile industry in the present day. It is ideal for low-level programming and is now being used to create high-performance applications and games. Major web applications such as Adobe and Mozilla are also steered by C++. It supports the two most popular Operating Systems: Windows and Mac OS X. C++ Programming skills are easily accessible as a large number of programmers are skilled in it. Hence, training resources for C++ are extensively available. It is interesting to note that Java and C# borrow their syntax from C++, USPs Best Suited For: iOS apps are primarily written using Objective-C programming language and Xcode, a development environment. It is the preferred app development language for writing software with native iOS platforms and Apple’s OS X, that is, fr devices such as iPhone or iPad. Objective-C is a superset of the C mobile app programming language and thus, borrows its syntax, primitive types, and flow control statements. This applies that its object-oriented syntax is small and easily understood, and it has a magnificent runtime. It is used for coding, designing the user interface for the app, running trials for the new application, and debugging. USPs Best Suited For mobile operating systems such as : The language used for writing code for Apple’s latest APIs, Cocoa and Cocoa Touch, is Swift. Swift is meant to be used in conjunction with Objective-C, as per Apple. But in the times to come, Apple anticipates many developers to take up Swift as a comprehensive mobile app programming language. An advantage of Swift over Objective-C is that it does away with the chances of occurrence of various security issues. So, Swift is the choice currently when it comes to writing apps for iOS. Swift would soon become available as an open-source, as announced by Apple at WWDC 2015 (Worldwide Developers’ Conference – a highlight of Apple’s yearly calendar). That will inevitably have more and more developers working with Swift. Also, the number of projects with Swift as the primary development language would also increase as a result of this advancement. USPs Best Suited For mobile operating systems such as : We all know about HTML or HyperText Markup Language, which was initially written to design Web apps stored on the Web but meant to run on mobile browsers. So, HTML5 becomes the obvious choice for Web-based or browser-based apps for mobile devices. It is preferred for mobile app development as it has useful tools like Offline Web Storage, GeoLocation API, Canvas Drawing, CSS3, to name just a few. It is easier to add different data types and streamline input factors in it. It is also possible to adjust the screen sizes, as needed, in HTML 5. For those, who are already familiar with HTML, learning HTML 5 mobile framework would be much easier, take up very little time to master, and would also be cost-effective. As the mobile game market is hot, developers are looking for the best methods for developing game apps that are accessible to a maximum number of users with minimum cost. Downside HTML5 can also pose the below-mentioned challenges : Best Suited For mobile operating systems such as : Just as Objective C is ‘The Language’ for app development on iOS, C#( C-Sharp)the most sought-after mobile app programming language for Windows OS, which does not imply that you cannot design Android or iOS apps using C#. This is made possible by using cross-platform tools, such as Unity and Xamarin. In fact, statistics suggest that 23% of Apple developers and 14% of Google Android developers use C# while only 10% use it to develop Windows apps. Yet, it is the most well-suited app development language for Windows. C# is an Object-Oriented, portable cross-language well-suited for all languages built on Microsoft Windows. It allows code extension to the developer. Windows platform-specific programs can be coded too so that they can also operate with the code of other Mobile App Programming Language. Its concepts are similar to Java and C++, but it uses only the beneficial part of those leaving out features that are confusing and can lead to errors, causing bugs in a code. C# programs are managed code, which means; they are coded and implemented in a controlled environment leaving no scope for irregularities or “bugs”, as we call them. It is a concise language even with the commands and supports effective and reusable components. USPs Ruby is an open-source mobile app programming language and a key provider of web apps. Software written in Ruby, predominantly in its Ruby on Rails web framework, is extremely popular and growing in demand. It is preferred by developers as it is a dynamic language that is extremely easy to learn. If you know Ruby or are a Ruby developer, you are in high demand in the mobile app development market. Its biggest plus is its emphasis on simplicity and efficiency. It has a sophisticated syntax that can be easily read and written. As per the TIOBE index, Ruby is among the top 10 programming languages globally. Being an open-source language, it is not only free of cost but also free to be used, copied, altered, and distributed. Talking about altering or editing, it gives users the ability to alter, remove or restructure its parts. Hence, it is also known to be a very flexible language. Coding can be done without any confines. The programmer does require configuring files to get set up as Rails has a ‘ready-to-use set of conventions which make it highly time-efficient. To code an iOS, Android, or OS X app in Ruby, programmers use RubyMotion, an innovative tool that helps in developing cross-platform native apps for the above Oss quickly. USPs Best Suited For mobile operating systems such as : Python is frequently labeled as one of the easiest mobile app programming languages around. Anybody can learn it, considering it has uncomplicated and straightforward syntax. It is also possible to run app programming python run anywhere as it is compatible with a host of application types, which includes Web development, scientific computing, education, and many more. You can find a Python framework for your varied requirements, be it web app development data analysis. It has grown drastically in popularity in the past few years, so much so that it is the most favored Mobile App Programming Language being taught in schools in the United States, generating a large talent pool, Some examples of famous applications written in Python are Pinterest and Instagram, and WordStream. It is simple to use, flexible, and easily readable enabling open source development. It is dynamically typed and, Its code is less wordy, carefully avoiding unnecessary detail. Mobile App Programming Language is an ever-growing industry, and the construction of new languages and constant upgrading of prevailing languages leads to a healthy competitive environment. It is entirely the choice of the developer to decide the efficiency and functionality language that is ideal for the app or program he has to write.

        "link": "https://www.africa.com/most-popular-mobile-apps-in-africa/",
        "desc": "Mobile messengers have taken over the communication world, with apps such as MXit and Whatsapp being the popular ones. 2Go has also taken the mobile messenger app world by storm, where users can chat with friends, create user profiles and upload profile pictures, meet new people in chat-rooms and play games in online rooms.",
        "body": "With studies by the Pew Research Center showing that while only one in ten individuals on the continent owned a mobile device in 2002, is has rapidly changed. Now more than two-thirds of people in five of Africa’s major mobile phone markets, namely South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana and Uganda, own a mobile phone and access the internet via their mobile phones. With a mobile phone growth rate of over 300 percent, Africa has skipped the landline development phase of communication altogether. Mobile phone ownership is especially high in South Africa and Nigeria with nine in ten individuals owning a mobile device. When it comes to mobile internet access, Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa are the countries with the highest number of mobile internet access on the continent with Ghana having an average mobile internet usage of 51 percent, followed by Nigeria with 47 percent according to results from the 2015 Mobile Africa study. The study also reveals that the most popular mobile phone brand is Samsung, and by default, Android is the most popular app store. Blackberry still maintains its market share in Africa as it introduced the internet to the continent with its cheaper data rates and easy access to social media, app downloads and email. A strong contender after Samsung is Apple as its popularity among users is rising significantly in Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa. South Africa leads in mobile apps downloads, signifying a higher smartphone adoption, with Ghana and Nigeria taking second and third place respectively. According to the Sub-Saharan African Mobile End-user Trends report, mobile phone penetration in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to increase from 52 percent in 2012 to 79 percent in 2020. This will make the region the fastest-growing globally over the next seven years. With much access to the internet and mobile technology, mobile apps are being downloaded daily. From a medical-based app that connects general healthcare workers directly to specialists, to one that aims to bridge the gap between farmers and businesses, here’s a look at some useful mobile apps in Africa. South African App WumDrop is a services and delivery app that works similarly to the popular ride-sharing service Uber. Customers type in their pick-up address, sender name, and contact details and then repeat for the drop-off details. Additional instructions can also be entered to ensure a proper delivery. After accepting the quote, the delivery is then dispatched to a WumDrop driver. WumDrop drivers, who apply via strict criteria including criminal checks, earn 70 percent of the delivery fee while WumDrop takes 30 percent. WumDrop charges under a dollar (R12) per kilometre, with a minimum fare of around $3.58 (R50). The app is free via the Google Play Store, and is currently only available in Johannesburg and Cape Town. The days where television service providers dictate what viewers watch and when they watch it are slowly fading away, with most consumers opting to select what they want to consume. IROKOtv supplies consumers with the freedom to choose their own programming. The Nigerian movie and TV series app has over 6,000 Nigerian and Ghanaian films, along with a selection of Bollywood, Hollywood and Korean movies too. Users download their favourite movies and TV series after signing up and subscribing to the service provider for around $2.50 per month. They are able to watch the movies and TV series offline on their Android device. The app is free on the Google Play Store. It is available to customers outside of Nigeria, and iROKOtv can also be accessed online. Agriculture is the largest economic sector in Africa, therefore it only makes sense for technology to bridge the gap between farmers and business. Esoko is a communication app for businesses, projects, NGOs and governments to connect with farmers. Founded in 2005 by acting CEO Mark Davies under the name TradeNet in Ghana. The name later changed to Esoko in 2009, with the word ‘e’ representing electronic and ‘soko’ meaning market in Swahili. The initial aim of the company was to provide a technology solution to collect and share market prices via SMS with farmers across most African countries. Today it also houses agricultural content and on-the-ground deployment services for any business needs with regards to agriculture. It is seen as the gateway to services such as marketing and goods sourcing, mobile money deployments, national farmer clubs and statistical services. Esoko currently operates in Ghana, Kenya, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Benin, Madagascar and Mozambique. Access to Esoko’s apps and services are only available after an initial sign up and registration on the website. In a world where being busy has taken time away from conventional cooking and driving to a restaurant for a quick bite, HelloFood offers the convenience of allowing users in Ghana to order food at a click of a button. Users are given an array of restaurants to choose from based on their location, while being able to customize their meals with various sauces and toppings. The app also offers exclusive deals to save you money. HelloFood was recently awarded the Best Mobile App Company of the Year at the 5th edition of the Ghana Telecom Awards. The app is available in Nigeria, Morocco, Kenya, Ghana, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Algeria and Egypt as a free download via the Google Play Store, iTunes and Microsoft. The rise of mobile phones on the continent has seen an increase in the popularity of mobile games. Leti Arts is an app for gaming fanatics who want an authentic African mobile game experience. Founded by Ghanaians Eyram Tawi and Wesley Kirinya in 2009, the two develop cross-platform interactive media products based on African history and folklore, including digital comics and mobile games. Their current game on offers is ‘Africa’s Legends’, a superhero series influenced by folklore and historic legends from across the continent. The game is currently receiving good reviews on the Google Play Store, with avid gamers saying that the game is interesting and offers a contemporary take on African folklore. Leti Arts games are available on the Google Play Store for free. The Safaricom M-Ledger app was created out of a need for M-PESA users to track and monitor their transactions. M-PESA is a popular money transfer and micro-financing service that was launched in 2007 by Vodafone for Safaricom and Vodacom. The service enables subscribers to deposit money, send money to any mobile number or bank account, withdraw money and make utility payments. The Safaricom M-Ledger allows M-PESA users to monitor their transactions by providing users with their financial status from their M-PESA transactions, and this information is stored on their smartphones. The app scans all the received SMS messages sent by M-PESA for all transactions and builds a database from that information. The app is free on the Google Play Store or the Safaricom App Store. Vula Mobile is a South African medical-based app that that connects general healthcare workers directly to specialists. The health practitioners can make referrals, get advice, find information, and undertake diagnostic tests, all through their mobile phone, resulting in more accurate diagnoses and more appropriate referrals. The app simplifies the current referral system used by health practitioners. Vula Mobile recently won the Most Innovative App award at the 2015 MTN App of the Year Awards. It is available for free on iTunes. EtCal is a popular app in Ethiopia that is used to track date and holidays in the Ethiopian calendar. It’s used to convert dates to or from the Gregorian calendar and view Ethiopian national holidays (including Muslim holidays), Ethiopian Orthodox fasts & feasts, and internationally recognized dates. The Ethiopian calendar is written in Ethiopia’s primary language, Amharic, and is different to the Gregorian calendar by 7 years due to the results from an alternate calculation in determining the date of the annunciation of Jesus Christ. It has received good reviews on the Google Play Store, with users saying that it is useful and makes date conversion simpler. It is available as a free download both on the Google Play Store and in the iTunes store. Mobile messengers have taken over the communication world, with apps such as MXit and Whatsapp being the popular ones. 2Go has also taken the mobile messenger app world by storm, where users can chat with friends, create user profiles and upload profile pictures, meet new people in chat-rooms and play games in online rooms. Even though the app is a South African app founded by Alan Wolff and Ashley Peters, the biggest user base in Africa is in Nigeria with over 10 million active users. Overall, it has more than 20 million active users in Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya. 2Go is available on the Google Play Store or via the 2Go website. While Uber is not an “African app”, it has certainly made getting around a lot easier in the six African countries it’s currently available in. Its global success has lead to the creation of many similar apps like the WumDrop app [also featured in this piece]. Uber connects riders to drivers in their specific city, and allows customers to roughly calculate the cost of their trip. You then pay the cab fee with Google Wallet, PayPal or a credit card and set up your pick up location, while being able to track the driver as he/she makes their way to you. The service was first launched in Africa in 2012, starting with three cities in South Africa – Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban. It is now also available in Lagos, Nairobi, and Cairo. The app is available for a free download via the Google Play Store or iTunes. While this innovative app is not for everyday use, it’s a useful one for Nigerians who love their Sallah holidays. Seeing as eating well prepared ram on Sallah Day is a must for most Nigerians over the 2 day public holiday, Ramlocator allows users to share their ram party on the platform. They add their location on Ramlocator, which is not shared publicly until they approve, and once approval is sent through, those who want to attend a party can search through the app to find one that is closest to them. Once the party is found, users wanting to attend will request an invite from the host. Thanks for reading and for your interest in Africa.

Intuitive Interface – The design of the interface should be both clean and intuitive. Keep each screen simple, and make buttons, numbers and text large. 2. Visualize Information – Banking is boring, with lots of numbers and text. Good mobile banking apps are functional, while great ones “dress up” otherwise dry information and make it as visually appealing as possible. 3. Quick Balance – Users can “preview” or “peek” at their account balance with a swipe — no login required. 4. Transaction Details – The app doesn’t just show the amount of payments made. It displays full contact info for the payee, including address, phone number (with click-to-call option) and a map showing where the charge was made. 5. Account Security – Beyond just regular passwords, users can opt for either biometric verification using Fingerprint ID or a gesture-based password method. 6. Debit Card On/Off – Lock or unlock your debit card for security in a single tap, while the actual account itself stays open. 7. Customer Service – Get help from a personal banker quickly, or set up an appointment with a financial advisor. Users should also be able to browse FAQ’s and video tutorials to get help without speaking to anyone. 8. Mobile Photo Check Deposit – Users can effortlessly deposit money into your account anytime, from virtually anywhere using your mobile device’s camera. This is a must-have feature. 9. Mobile Photo Bill Pay – Users can take a photo of their bill and the app will upload all the necessary billing information so they can set up a one-time or recurring payment in a matter of moments. 10. Branch/ATM Locator – Users should be able to locate your financial institution’s branches and ATMs based on either their current GPS location or a search function. Results should include hours of operation and phone numbers (with click-to-call functionality). It’s helpful to list what services each location provides — e.g., ATMs that accept deposits. 11. Personal Financial Management Tools (PFM) – View, aggregate and manage money with goals, spending alerts, spending categories and visual tools. 12. Safe-to-Spend – It’s one thing to know your “available balance” which can be misleading and result in reckless spending. It’s another thing to know exactly how much you have available to spend. At a glance, users should be able to know how much they have left after their scheduled bill payments, pending transactions and savings goals have been accounted for. (Hat tip to Simple for this idea.) 13. Receipts – Users can take photos of receipts to help them keep track of expenses. This really only works if you are offering PFM as well. 14. Person-to-Person Payments – Quickly and securely transfer money to anyone at any time using just their mobile phone number or email address. 15. Travel Notification – Users can quickly let their financial institution know they will be traveling. All it takes is a swipe or tap. 16. Personalization/Customization – Users can quickly view a list of their most frequent actions (e.g., a shortcut listing recurring bill pays). They can customize their dashboard, menu or interface to suit their needs/situation. They can personalize their profile, with a nickname and photo. 17. Credit Monitoring – The app displays the user’s credit score, updated monthly. 18. Mobile Photo Account Opening – A user can snap a picture of their driver’s license and be on their way to opening a new account in less than five minutes. It’s a handy feature when the need arises, but one that will probably be used fairly rarely. 19. Wearables Integration – Users can customize their settings to receive various alerts and notifications related to their accounts and/or spending patterns — e.g., account balances, recent transactions, transaction details and other important messages.

        "title": "11 Best Cross Platform Mobile App Development Tools ...",
        "link": "https://buildfire.com/best-mobile-cross-platform-development-tools/",
        "desc": "The best mobile app developers keep all of this in mind. But in order to do this properly and efficiently, you'll need to find the mobile app development tools. This isn't easy with so many options available on the market. So refer to the list above to guide you in the right direction.",
        "body": "Picking the right app development tools is a critical part of building a good app. But there are certain factors that come into play when you’re trying to decide which tool is best for cross platform app development. Often times, the platform that you want to build for dictates which types of tools you’ll be using. You’re going to use different tools depending on if you’re building for Apple or Android. For example, if your app is being built strictly for the Google Play Store then you’ll use Android Studio for native app development. Whereas Xcode is used for iOS apps on Apple’s operating system. However, cross platform development framework technology means that you can develop for both platforms simultaneously. Cross platform app development makes things much easier for developers, that way you won’t have to go through the same process twice on two separate platforms. How do you pick the right tool for cross platform mobile apps? There are so many different options to choose for cross platform mobile app development. It can be difficult to narrow down which ones are the best for cross platform apps. There are four main factors that should influence your decision. You’ve got to take these elements into consideration when you’re analyzing cross platform development tools. To help get you started, I’ve already conducted research. I used these components to help narrow down the top options available. Here are the 10 best cross platform mobile app development tools:  Appcelerator Titanium is one of the top choices available.  The Titanium SDK operates using JavaScript. Their system makes it really easy for you to create native apps for both iOS and Android. It allows you to reuse between 60% and 90% of the same code for all of your apps. This feature is a huge time saver. For all of you developers out there who have gone through the coding process before, you know how much time and effort it takes to code from scratch. The ability to get a head start and have more than half of the code already done is why Appcelerator Titanium is such a popular choice and you can use for hybrid mobile app development. Titanium is also an open-source development tool. So thousands of developers across the globe are always making contributions. As a result, the performance and functionality of this resource are constantly improving. Who knows, you might even find a way to make this tool better as well. You can repair and bugs or glitches in this system if you find one while you’re working. It will help other developers who use this tool in the future. The design features for Titanium are great as well. They make it really easy for you to just drag and drop templates. You can move from the design aspects back to the code components with seamless effort. In addition to Java, Titanium also allows you to use code from Swift and Objective C simultaneously with its own code. If you’re building an app that’s for a two-dimensional game, you might want to consider using Cocos2d as your cross platform development tool.  Just like Titanium, Cocos2d is also an open-source platform. So there are always updates and improvements being made to it by other developers. If you’re using this tool, you’ve got the option to choose between five different platforms or forks to develop with. The differences between these forks are based on your preferred programming language as a developer. So if you’re familiar with Xcode and Objective-C, you’ll want to use Cocos2d-Swift. For those of you that prefer the C# language, you should use Cocos2dXNA. For JavaScript, Cocos2d-JS is the best option. If you like the C++ language, then Cocos2d-x is your best bet. Just like the name says, Cocos2d(Python) is made for the Python programming language. The programming language versatility on Cocos2d is what makes it such a popular option for developers. Working with a language that you’re familiar with helps make sure that you’re getting things done as quickly and efficiently as possible. Some known gaming apps that were built using this cross platform development tool include: This can give you an idea of the quality that comes from this tool. Let’s stick with the gaming theme here. Unity3d is another option that you should consider if you’re developing a game.  The reason why this cross platform development tool is so popular is because the graphics are absolutely incredible. It’s so great that it can be used for more than just a mobile app. After you develop the code using Boo, C#, or UnityScript, you’ve got the ability to export the game to 17 platforms. Some of the top ones include: After your game is up and running on all of the different platforms that you’ve selected, you can use the Unity3d platform to help you distribute it to all of the stores. You can also use Unity3d to track user analytics and get social shares for your app. Unity3d has a network of developers and experts called Unity Connect. If you join this network you find help and get questions answered if you’re having trouble with something. On the flip side, if you’re an expert with this development tool, you can join the community and get paid to offer advice to those in need of some extra guidance. PhoneGap is owned by Adobe. So if you’re familiar with other Adobe products, you know how reliable and easy to use they are.  One of the best features of this cross platform development tool is that it’s free to use. It’s easy to translate code from CSS, JavaScript, and HTML5. This is one of the top options to use if you’re building an app for the first time as a developer. All of the software development kits are maintained by PhoneGap, so you don’t have to worry about handling that. After you finish developing the app, they make it super simple for you to share it with the other members of your team. This feature helps you collaborate with others so you can continuously make improvements for your app. You’ll also be able to get your app ready for the app stores while using PhoneGap. In addition to Android and iOS development, you can also build apps for Windows and BlackBerry using PhoneGap. The software allows you to significantly lower your development time. That’s because you get to reuse existing frameworks, tools, and web development skills. PhoneGap has something called a Hydration feature. It allows for faster build cycles and debugging. This will get updates pushed to the users who have tested your app to make sure that everyone works on the most recent version. You’ll use HTML5 to develop your apps with Sencha.  They have lots of products, but the main one for developers is Ext Js 5. The reason why developers like it is because it works well with different devices and platforms. So if you use Sencha, it’s easier to work with multiple members of your team no matter where you are. Ultimately, this will boost productivity. They also offer lots of pre-built elements that will save you lots of time when it comes to coding. You won’t necessarily get the code translated for you, but you’ll still save plenty of time. After you develop the HTML5 code, it’s easy to incorporate it with both Android and iOS platforms. Simply use a translation tool, such as PhoneGap, which we just discussed. In addition to coding, you’ll also have access to design tools. You can create reusable themes without having to write any code. Sencha also has great testing tools. The testing features are specifically meant for apps built using Ext JS, so you’ll get the most accurate results from these tests. Proper testing ensures quality and reduces the time and costs associated with testing from other resources. Even some of the top Fortune 100 companies use this development tool to build mobile applications. Qt is a subscription service for mobile development.  Before you buy it, they give you the option to try it out for free. So it’s definitely worth taking advantage of their free trial at the very least. If you use Qt to code your app then you’ll be using C++ to do so. After the coding is complete, there is a seamless export process to various platforms. After you export the code, you can access you the apps through the Qt interface on the respective devices and platforms. That way you monitor how well your app is performing. If the app is not performing to your liking, you can easily make changes through Qt that will automatically get applied. You can also test your app on various devices, even if you don’t own those specific devices. Their software allows you to see how the app will perform on various smartphones and tablets. Another positive of this cross platform development tool is the speed. The API tools help you get your app to market much faster. Overall, it’s really easy to use. They don’t have a complicated interface like some of the other development tools I’ve seen. Corona advertises that you can start the coding process of your new app in less than five minutes with their software development kit.  So it’s safe to say that there isn’t too much of a learning curve with this cross platform development tool. It’s easy to use and even great for beginners. It’s free to use, so there is no harm in giving it a try. You won’t have to invest anything into it except for your time. Corona’s primary use is for 2D games. It’s great for high quality graphics and can help you create games much faster than coding the entire app from scratch. You’ll be working in Lua, which is Corona’s programming language that’s written in C. The reason why they use Lua is because they discovered that it works well with mobile apps since it doesn’t have a large digital footprint. 5app is pretty unique compared to the other tools that we’ve talked about so far today.  The reason why it’s different is because it’s designed for businesses that are developing apps for their employees. It’s also great for people who are hired by those businesses to make apps employees to use. 5app puts emphasis on data security. It uses JavaScript and HTML5 to code and export apps. Your finished product is compatible with both iOS and Android devices, depending on what your company employees use. If you’re a developer that likes to have lots of different options for your programming language, you should consider using Alpha Anywhere to develop on multiple platforms.  You can use programming languages like: You can also use any language that’s supported by .NET such as C++ and Cobra. Alpha Anywhere uses data integration to securely connect to SQL and no-SQL databases. That way you can leverage REST services. You can even access your business application while you’re offline. Another top feature of this tool is that it has a huge storage capacity. When it comes to GPS and GIS for your mobile app, Alpha Anywhere has what you need to integrate these features into your app. They also have a calendar feature that makes it really easy for you to schedule your tasks between all of your devices. React Native is an open source software that was created by Facebook. You can use it to create native apps for iOS and Android.  React Native has quickly become one of the top solutions for anyone who develops apps. The cool part about React Native is that it also works for more than just mobile apps. You can use it to create native applications for web apps, Windows, UWP, tvOS, macOS, Android TV, and more. So it’s truly a cross platform and cross device solution. Last, but certainly not least, is Xamarin.  They’ve got a free package offered for starters. This tool also has app store delivery capabilities once you finish developing your app. I like Xamarin because of the features for monitoring your app’s performance and the ability to run tests. You can do testing on over 1,000 devices to help sort out any potential bugs. Xamarin uses C# or Ruby for coding. This tool has been used by well-recognized companies such as IBM, Foursquare, and Microsoft. Picking the right platform to develop cross platform apps for is one of the most critical parts of building a native app. You just need to narrow down the best cross platform frameworks. This is the easiest way to handle multiple platform app development. But now you’ve got the ability to build a cross platform mobile app. This allows you to quickly and easily capitalize on the enormous audiences of both iOS and Android users. So you won’t have to worry about alienating certain groups and you’re not forced to develop for just one platform. This will allow you to maximize your revenue. You’ll also need to consider web apps, as this falls into the cross platform category as well. Native mobile apps, Android and iOS apps, Windows mobile app engineering, and hybrid apps are all different. The best mobile app developers keep all of this in mind. But in order to do this properly and efficiently, you’ll need to find the mobile app development tools. This isn’t easy with so many options available on the market. So refer to the list above to guide you in the right direction. What cross platform development tools are you using to build your mobile app?"

        "body": "Our editors independently research and recommend the best products and services. You can learn more about our independent review process and partners in our advertiser disclosure. We may receive commissions on purchases made from our chosen links. Stock trading apps are applications that can be downloaded on your mobile phone or tablet that allow you to trade stocks and manage your portfolio on the go anytime. These apps can be for infrequent investors or those who trade daily.  The best stock trading apps are easy to use, have features to help you meet your trading goals, offer some form of customer support, and make it easy to transfer money from your bank account into your brokerage account. These apps charge affordable fees and offer a wide range of assets to trade. With a variety of account types, no minimum deposits, and $0 commissions for online stock trades, TD Ameritrade is our top pick for the best stock trading apps.  Low-cost accounts Beginner and advanced mobile apps Support for a wide range of assets and account types Extensive research resources Uncertainty of future after Schwab acquisition TD Ameritrade gets the top spot because it offers something for everyone and excellent pricing. The basic TD Ameritrade Mobile app is great for beginners and casual stock traders who want to manage their investments on the go. Advanced and expert traders can use the upgraded thinkorswim mobile app for a professional-style experience. You get access to both apps with a TD Ameritrade brokerage account, which has no minimum balance requirements and no fees to trade stocks and ETFs. The fully-featured apps combine important account management features and trading features regardless of which one you choose. thinkorswim also includes a live CNBC feed inside the app. In November 2019, Charles Schwab announced that it is acquiring TD Ameritrade.1 The acquisition was completed in 2020. According to the firm, services will begin combining over the next 18 to 36 months. Since it comes with no minimum deposit requirements, intuitive screens, and easy-to-learn features, Fidelity is our choice as best for beginners.  Investment and trading features meet the needs of most traders Support for a wide range of account types Extensive research and education resources Few advanced charting options Fidelity is a top brokerage for beginner investors and anyone with a focus on long-term and retirement investments. It’s full-service, with a wide range of account and investment types supported. With $0 stock and ETF trades, you get a lot of services at a low cost. Fidelity Investments is Fidelity's app for Android, iOS, and Amazon devices. It includes anything you need to manage your Fidelity investment accounts and enter trades. It doesn’t have as many advanced charting features as some competing mobile apps, but that’s just fine for beginners who may not want or need advanced features. Webull offers a no-commission platform with no minimum deposits and generous stock promotions for new users, making it an ideal choice for the best free app.  No commissions platform-wide Paper trading available (virtual currency trading) Limited assets available Limited customer service options Webull is a technology-centric trading app that’s best for stock traders with at least some experience. Webull isn’t heavy on educational resources, but it’s filled with tons of useful features. Active and expert traders will enjoy advanced charting and optional add ons for advanced quote data. With all of these advanced features, you may expect an advanced price tag. However, Webull is almost completely free to use. There are no commissions for any trades on the app, including stocks and ETFs. However, that’s all there is to trade in the app. Cryptocurrencies are new to the platform, but you won’t find bonds, mutual funds, or other assets. While Webull is a newer app than most others on this list, it doesn’t lack in features for active stock traders. SoFi offers robust tools to help you learn more about stocks and put them into practice on the same app.  Low fees Easily trade full or fractional shares Member events Limited tradable assets Few types of accounts SoFi, short for Social Finance, offers loans, banking, and investments through a convenient mobile app. It’s ideal for investors looking to learn about stock trading. This brokerage offers commission-free trades and fractional shares in an account with no minimum balance and $5 needed to start investing. Learning section articles are a part of the SoFi Invest tab in the app, making it easier for beginners to manage their accounts without getting overwhelmed. Due to its niche options and features set up just for options trading as well as capped fees, tastyworks is our top pick for options trading.  Capped fees for options trades Advanced options trading features Follow community members for trade ideas Many account types supported Not the cheapest per-contract fee tastyworks isn’t a household name like some of the biggest brokerage firms, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t the best at what it does. Its app is ultra-focused on options trading. While those are not exactly shares of stock, many options trade based on stock price movements, so tastyworks earns a mention on this list. Stock and ETF trades are fee-free. Options on stocks and ETFs cost $1 per contract with a $10 maximum per leg. The mobile app is best for traders with some options experience, as there are many features that can distract and overwhelm newer traders. tastyworks has essential features for options traders that make trades fast without giving up many desktop trading features. Ally is our choice as the best app that works with banking products as it gives you access to your banking accounts as well as your trading account on one easy-to-use platform.  Pair bank accounts with your investments in one app User-friendly stock trades Simple and easy to use and manage Mobile app research somewhat limited Some advanced traders may find trading tools limited Ally features high-quality checking, savings, and investment accounts all in one mobile app. While you can definitely get bank accounts from some other brokers on this list, Ally Bank is one of the very best for online checking and savings regardless of investment needs. Once you factor in the low-cost, easy-to-use brokerage accounts, you get a winning bank/investment combo. Ally charges no commissions for stock or ETF trades. Charts and data are fairly basic, but offer anything a beginner investor may want. It’s not the best for advanced features, but it covers most common needs with excellent pricing. There are lots of options when it comes to choosing a stock trading app. Some companies are known for affordable fees and others offer beginner-friendly platforms. Overall, TD Ameritrade Mobile is the best stock trading app. It is easy to use, has a platform for beginners as well as a separate platform for more advanced traders. It also has affordable fees and no minimum balance requirements.  Before diving into stock trading, you will want to identify your specific trading goals. You will want to consider the reasons you’re trading, if your goals are long-term or more short-term, and if you will be a passive or a more aggressive trader. You should also consider your budget including how much you’re comfortable investing and your profit expectations.  Keep in mind things like your ideal timeline and if you’re trading to have more financial freedom, to educate yourself on the stock market, or to diversify your wealth.  When comparing stock trading apps, there are several things that you should consider. Make sure to research each app and check out its overall ratings and reviews. Keep the following in mind when comparing stock trading apps: Once you download the stock trading app, there are numerous ways to actively use it. You can use it on the go to buy and sell stocks. You can also research stocks to see how they’re performing and even look up the company’s stock tickers that you didn’t know. Other tools include adding stocks to your watchlist, and using indicators, and charts to analyze and track your investments. You can use a stock trading app to buy and sell shares of stock, as well as other investment products. A stock trading app is easy for most people who are comfortable with stock market basics and smartphones. Start by signing up for a brokerage account at your preferred brokerage from the list above. All brokerage accounts on this list have no minimum deposit required to open the account and charge no recurring fees. It’s often easiest to open an account online with your computer, though you usually have the option to open an account directly through the mobile app, as well. After you open your account, download the mobile app and log in to get started buying and selling. Remember that stocks can go up and down in value. Never make an investment or trade that you don’t fully understand to avoid unneeded risk. You can open an account with most major brokerages with no opening deposit. But that doesn’t mean you can buy and sell stocks for free. Most brokers require you to have enough cash to buy full shares of stock, which can range from less than $5 to more than $1,000 per share. Fidelity and SoFi both allow you to buy fractional shares, which means you can buy less than a full share at once. This lets you start buying stocks with very little money. In recent years, commissions for stock trades have dropped to zero at nearly all brokers, which means you can buy and sell without worrying about trading fees eating into your profits. Everyone has different trading goals and experience levels, so it’s important to look at your stock trading background and how you plan to invest when picking a brokerage and stock trading app. The most important places to look are fees, tradable assets, available account types, and ease-of-use for the platform. Ease-of-use is subjective, so take a few minutes to explore screenshots and even demo accounts before locking yourself in. If you’re not sure, you can always try two or three different apps to choose your favorite. With no minimum balance requirements, you can open an account and check things out before funding your account with real money. To find the best stock trading apps, we started by creating a list of the 20 most popular brokerage apps. Next, we closely evaluated each company based on several factors including ease-of-use, trading fees, and supported account types. We also considered tradable assets and minimum deposit requirements, as well as any additional features such as learning tools and integration with bank accounts.

What exactly are you looking for in a mobile app? #2. What would be the easiest app for your donors to adopt? #3. Would you consider offering more than one way to give? #4. What would the monetary cost be? What about the cost in time? #5. How would your organization need to shift to incorporate the new technology? #6. What customer service needs would you have? #7. Would your fundraising team have to expand to accommodate the changes? #8. Would the new information seamlessly integrate into your CRM? #9. How soon could you access donations? #10. Does the platform offer security and peace-of-mind? If you happen to be a church that’s looking for an online tithing tool, check out this resource just for you!   When shopping for the best mobile app, the first place you actually need to look is within your own organization. It may seem somewhat counterintuitive that the first place you have to research is your own backyard. But bear with us. Because there are so many choices out there, it’s important to note first and foremost what you’re hoping to achieve.  Are you a large organization who just wants to offer an alternative way for your existing donors to give? Are you a smaller nonprofit that’s looking to reach new donors on the go? Regardless of who you are and where you are: you can’t possibly pick the perfect mobile giving app if you don’t first take a step back and assess your nonprofit’s needs.   While you’re assessing what your nonprofit’s fundraising needs are, be sure that you take a look at your typical donors. How have they given to your organization in the past? Have any of your donors expressed interest in giving via mobile?  You can easily find out if your donors would be on board with mobile giving by surveying them. Conversely, you can also examine the demographics of your organization. Do you have a lot of younger donors for whom text-to-give would be enticing? Or do you have an older constituency who might be more partial to an easy-to-use online donation page, like the one below?  Whatever the case: you should take a poll of your existing donor base before you choose or settle on any one type of mobile app.   There are a dozen ways to use mobile giving apps, and within those ways there are hundreds of ways to customize your approach. It’s perfectly acceptable to offer just one way to give, if that’s what makes sense for your organization. But if you want to offer multiple options to fit the needs of a diverse donor base, then it’s something you need to consider. The optimal mobile giving app for your nonprofit would encompass all of these facets. There are several platforms that offer all of these options and more: Within those options, you’ll want to be sure that your nonprofit can customize each approach. There are few things worse for mobile giving than donation pages that don’t fit in with your organization’s overall internet presence and look.   It depends. With some companies, you’ll be charged a flat fee, and with others the cost of the mobile giving platform changes based on the size of your organization (among various other factors). Some companies will have you request an estimate or call in for a quote. Others will tell you right up front that the fee is $50-$100 per month. Also, depending on the type of organization you represent, you can find deals. Some companies offer discounts to churches and other faith-based organizations. There are even some sites that will allow you to run a free trial of their mobile giving platforms, just so you can be sure. All in all, your organization should look into the different costs that mobile giving presents, both in time and money. If a mobile giving app takes more time to set up than your organization can afford, then it may not be the app for you. That being said, the cost in time and money that you may incur at the outset should be made up for by the increased revenue that your new mobile giving app will bring in.   As with any major transition within your nonprofit, incorporating a new avenue for fundraising should cause you to shift the way you do things a little bit. Before you commit to any mobile giving app, you need to make sure that your nonprofit is in a good place to shift. You should also make sure that the app you choose isn’t going to rock the boat too much. What your nonprofit needs is a happy medium: a mobile giving platform that provides payment processing should you need it or steps back if you have your own methods. One that works with your CRM or one that provides easily exportable data. Whatever your needs are, you’ll want to make sure that your mobile app satisfies them–and that you’re not bending over backwards to incorporate the new technology.  With most mobile giving platforms, there is customer support that should be included in the monthly subscription. Generally, there is a support hotline that can be called during business hours, and the rest of the time, there are online portals that accept questions and provide guidance. The customer support can be called by the organization or by anyone who happens to use the software to donate. If you have a number of Spanish-speaking members in your organization, there are platforms that specifically provide bilingual support. All of that being said, before you choose a mobile giving app, you should figure out what your customer service needs might be.  Will you need someone 24/7? Do you foresee needing little to no help? Or are you anticipating needing more guidance until you can be more independent? These are the questions you should ask yourself before you start to compare different platforms. In the end, though, it’s better to have a safety net. It never hurts to have too much support.   When you’re looking into adopting a new means of fundraising, it’s important to figure out if that change will require expanding your team. Do you have someone who could take on the tasks associated with getting your mobile fundraising campaigns up and running? Would you need to hire a new team member, or could you reallocate some of your existing staff’s time? Taking on a mobile giving app doesn’t necessarily have to shift your nonprofit’s internal structure. But if it does, you want to be sure that you know what that might look like, so you can prepare accordingly.   Since most platforms are all-inclusive now, meaning they provide every facet of the mobile giving experience (email, text, mobile web), it’s extremely easy to keep track of all of the donations you’ve made across the board. It’s also easy for your nonprofit to have an idea of all of the different ways people are donating, which is useful for planning future fundraisers. Top-rated mobile giving apps will provide easily exportable data for your nonprofit to integrate into its CRM.  Be on the look-out for the companies that can offer this level of seamless integration.   Once upon a time, cell phone companies were the only mobile fundraising game in town. Not only would they skim a little off the top of all of the donations made via text, but they would also hold all of the donations for a period of no less than 45 days! The average wait for most nonprofits was upwards of 90 days before they saw any money. Standards have changed, and mobile giving apps now offer nonprofits the ability to access funds within a couple of business days. Make sure you ask your mobile giving platform provider about the time it takes to access donations. Note: if your provider is part of the Mobile Giving Foundation, they may still adhere to some of the rules and practices which have traditionally limited text-giving services. For more information on the Mobile Giving Foundation and how they can impact your fundraising, read this helpful resource.  With the industry-leading technology backing the best mobile giving apps, mobile giving is 100% secure for your donors and for your organization. The top companies will let you know if they’re something called, “PCI-compliant.” Without going into the technical jargon that this entails, suffice it to say that Level 1 PCI-compliance guarantees the highest level of security on the market today. Fraud analysis and encrypted data should also be standard. You also never have to worry about your email getting hacked; no critical information (like credit card info, date of birth, etc.) is ever transmitted through email. All of that private information should be stored in PCI-compliant vaults–which are just as secure as they sound. Now that you’ve taken all of these factors into consideration, you’re ready to get out there and find the best mobile giving app for your organization!

        "body": "Mobile app design is a growing field and just like web design there’s a constant need for quality inspiration. Most designers borrow ideas from other designers and very few ideas (if any) are truly original. Thankfully there are dozens of sites you can use to find mobile UI inspiration if you know where to look. In this post I’ll share my 10 top sources for app UI design for Android & iOS devices including both smartphones and tablets. There are dozens of niche inspiration galleries online but very few compare to Mobile Design Inspiration. This is one of the best blogs for mobile UI/UX ideas with new posts are added weekly. And their gallery dates back with hundreds of examples of beautiful app UIs for all devices. Most shots focus on a certain device like a smartphone or a tablet showcasing the app UI screen in the device. But some posts even have UX animations for sliding menus, loading bars, or page swipe effects. And if you plan to design for the Apple Watch you’ll be happy to know there’s a full category dedicated to Apple Watch app UI inspiration. They also have a Creative Fields section where you can find inspiration for product logo designs too, which can be handy if you’re designing an app icon from scratch. This is by far the most dense inspiration gallery for mobile app design. It’s full of UX animations too so if you’re a UI designer with an interest in motion you’ll find a lot of inspiration on this site. My favorite community for design inspiration is Dribbble. It does have a large signal-to-noise ratio so you really need to put in some effort to stumble onto whatever you’re looking for. But I find the search feature works really well so you can type any combination of keywords for mobile UI/UX inspiration and probably find some great stuff. The site is super easy to use and since it’s an invite-only network so the quality is superb. This is absolutely the largest repository of new designs on the web and if you’ve never browsed Dribbble before I would highly recommend that you give it a try. Along with Dribbble is the free portfolio site Behance. This is like Dribbble except it’s completely free so anyone can sign up for an account. In many ways this dilutes the quality because anybody can post anything they want, and with such a large userbase there’s a lot of content to go through. But it’s also open to anyone so you have a lot more content at your fingertips. Behance is super easy to search and it features thousands of mobile app design ideas. I would recommend browsing through the community to see what’s available. You can find app icons, splash screens, and full app UI mockups(some with free PSDs). Mobile interface patterns are like repeatable UIs that you can apply to any situation. Think search forms, login pages, user profiles, and live feeds. The Mobile Patterns site is a treasure trove of mobile app UI patterns and design inspiration. It’s an online gallery full of screenshots from real mobile applications organized by different patterns. You can filter by Android or iPhone screens, or you can search through tags like login pages or settings for mobile apps. If you’re looking for design ideas for specific UI pages then Mobile Patterns will prove incredibly valuable. One of the longest running inspiration galleries is pttrns. In the past few years it has grown tremendously to focus more on mobile app design and interface inspiration. They have the largest sortable gallery of mobile app design inspiration you can find on the web. You can browse through over 100 different tags for empty state pages, shopping carts, popover windows, and other similar interface designs. Best of all these patterns aren’t limited to whole pages. They focus on individual elements used in mobile app design. And all the examples come from real world apps so you’ll be drawing inspiration from tangible app interfaces. I recently stumbled onto Mobile Mozaic and it’s one of my new favorite sites. This is yet another gallery full of mobile UI/UX inspiration but it covers everything from basic smartphone apps to custom game UIs. Most of the posts are curated from real screenshots but some feature mockup designs created on spec for pretend projects. All the UI patterns are organized by tags like login screens, timelines, messaging UIs, and other common app interfaces. The site is hand curated but you can submit your own screenshots if you have an app or mockup you want to add into the gallery. With a total of 6,600 designs and counting I have to say Collect UI might be one of the largest inspiration galleries on the web. It offers a variety of interfaces for desktop software, responsive websites, and mobile applications. You can sort through hundreds of tags based on labels like shopping carts, user profiles, and signup/login forms. All shots are taken from Dribbble and link back to the original author. This may seem like a roundabout way to just browse through Dribbble. However I do think this makes inspiration seeking easier because only the top-tier shots from Dribbble are admitted into the gallery. And you can filter for specific pages or tags which don’t always yield great results on Dribbble. Some designers like the Dribbble-style designs but many prefer real screenshots from real applications. This leads me to Inspired UI which is a growing web gallery of mobile & tablet app UI inspiration. All photos are taken directly from real applications so you can study practical interface designs. This means you’ll have a much easier time mimicking the UIs in your own designs but you may also feel a bit limited with creativity. I think Inspired UI offers a pragmatic approach to design inspiration. You may not get the most fanciful designs but you’ll find interfaces from real applications that are used by real people every day. If the apps are successful then their interfaces must do something right. Another big inspiration gallery is UI Garage which also curates real application interfaces. All submissions are from real app screenshots and they focus on different aspects like alerts, form inputs, image galleries, and tons of other UI elements. The site is pretty easy to browse and the interfaces are very easy to sort through. Plus the entire site works like an SPA so content loads dynamically on the page. They also have an e-mail newsletter with new design inspiration but this won’t be useful to everyone. Many designers just want to find inspiration for their current project and then move on. But UI Garage’s newsletter is a quality choice if you’re looking for inspiration delivered to your inbox. Lastly I love to browse through design blogs just to see what I can find. Google is your best friend here if you punch in “design blog” + mobile inspiration to see what sort of galleries pop up. I’m constantly looking for mobile app icons and specific pages like splash screens. The above galleries are fantastic but you can also find incredible resources on top design blogs. Some even focus on UI inspiration enough to have their own gallery/inspiration categories. Since all three are primarily web design blogs you’ll find a lot of web design inspiration galleries mixed in with mobile UI/UX galleries. But they’re all fantastic choices and they update frequently enough that you can check back often for new content. And if you still can’t find anything then hit Google and search for mobile app UI inspiration. You might be surprised how much is out there if you take the time to look. I hope these 10 resources can lead you down the path to better mobile interface design. Mobile apps have only been around for half a decade but they’ve grown quickly. Designing a great app isn’t rocket science but it’s also not an easy task. Thankfully these sites can offer more than enough inspiration to help you plan your mobile interfaces and dive confidently into the design phase. Mobile app design is vital for any business today if it aims to provide excellent user experience. According to studies,users spend 89% of their smartphone media time in mobile apps. That’s huge! Moreover, more than 50% of people wake up and start using their mobile phones immediately. This knowledge dramatically increases the importance of a mobile app design. Wow, thank you very much for your words of encouragement and advice. You share superb features of Application Design, I’ll have to look into that! Great article, it was very amazing post and more information got me in this post if I like this post and this point there are dozens of sites you can use to find mobile UI inspiration if you know where to look. In this post I’ll share my 10 top sources for app UI design for Android & IOS devices including both smartphones and tablets. thanks… thanks for this best resources of your mobile app designs which is very inspirational. Great stuff! Good… nice, thanks Thanks for the list. Helpful Nice inspirational designs… thanks (y) Nice and inspiration blog post for me.

        "body": "Discover Editions More from Quartz Follow Quartz These are the core obsessions that drive our newsroom—defining topics of seismic importance to the global economy. These are some of our most ambitious editorial projects. Enjoy! Our emails are made to shine in your inbox, with something fresh every morning, afternoon, and weekend. A look at the top 25 most popular mobile apps in the US, as measured by comScore, leads to several observations. Some 21 of the top 25 apps, as ranked by comScore, were the same in June 2015 as a year ago, when we first published this list. Eight of the top 10 were the same. Those were: Facebook, YouTube, Google Search, Google Play, Google Maps, Pandora Radio, Gmail, and Instagram. The main new top-10 entrant was Facebook Messenger, which was ranked no. 3 in June 2015, up from no. 12 a year ago. Its massive success highlights two things: The importance of messaging as a primary mobile activity, and Facebook’s ability to split itself into two apps and successfully drive adoption of Messenger. Three of the top 10 apps are owned by Facebook, including the main Facebook app, which is the only app in the US that reaches more than 100 million people a month, according to comScore. (Some 126 million, or about two-thirds of the total US app-using market.) Five are owned by Google, which has the benefit of controlling Android, the dominant (for now) US mobile operating system. Pinterest—a private company valued at $11 billion—has gained ground, up from no. 20 a year ago. And its app audience has increased by two-thirds since then, to more than 40 million, according to comScore. As comScore’s Andrew Lipsman explains, while gaming is a huge category—representing 11% of time spent on mobile devices—it tends to be more fragmented among many successful games, which include Words With Friends, Trivia Crack, and Clash of Clans. Its 33 million unique mobile-app visitors, as estimated by comScore, represents almost 80% of the 42 million US streaming members it reported at the end of June. Except, of course, Facebook, which is planning a lot of its future around mobile video. With 49 million estimated unique visitors in June, that’s almost 60% reach among the roughly 84 million iPhone subscribers in the US. Skype, which made the list last year, has fallen off. And Microsoft’s struggles in mobile are well-documented. A note on methodology: comScore measures app audience size by “unique visitors,” a term that is different than the “monthly active users” that many app-makers self-report. This is measured by a combination of techniques, including a panel of users, and input from publishers. The idea is to report the number of actual people using each app or service, not the number of devices. As with any third-party measurement, it’s imperfect. For example, the rankings include “iTunes Radio/iCloud,” two of Apple’s cloud services, at no. 10. ComScore says it can’t fully distinguish between the two on the back end, so it combines them. This is not ideal, but, we think, worth sharing. And, for context, here’s last year’s list: 📬 Kick off each morning with coffee and the Daily Brief (BYO coffee).

        "body": "Gone are the days when possession of mobile was confined only to the so-called elite and financially competent segment of the society. But, the scenario has drastically changed with technological advancements over the past decade. Today, everyone has a smartphone. Right from teenage students to the old age people, everyone has a smartphone irrespective of their age, social backdrop, economic construct, and geographical setting. This comprehensive ownership of mobile phones has consequently lead to an increase in demand for efficient and exceptionally operative mobile apps. To build these high-end mobile applications, we need skilled developers. Thus, if you wish to outshine in the software development industry as a mobile app developer, which is certainly a promising career, then you should consider learning these 10 Best Mobile Development Languages in 2020. Disclosure: Coursesity is supported by the learners community. We may earn an affiliate commission when you make a purchase via links on Coursesity. JAVA is one of the most sought-after programming languages which offer a vibrant spectrum of features. JAVA is contemplated to be the best language for Android development. What makes JAVA dynamic is the object-oriented paradigm which it follows. Flexibility, versatility, portability, and platform-independence are some of the traits which work in support of JAVA. It works well for cross-platform app development as well. It also has efficient open-source development tools. Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that was developed to overrule the shortcomings of JAVA for Android app development. Kotlin can be used in combination with JAVA to make more efficient and high-performance apps. Kotlin has very clean syntax and simple code. It is interoperable and versatile. It generates compact and cleaner code as compared to JAVA. Thus, it is the most popular language used for Android application development. Swift is majorly used for iOS app development. Before the advent of native application development, Swift retained a monopoly in the iOS app development business but then Objective-C came into the picture, which was not that efficient and eventually was ruled-out by Swift. Swift, later on, was made open-source by Apple and was made available for the developer's community. According to the official documentation, Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS and beyond. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and Swift includes modern features developers love. Swift code is safe by design, yet also produces software that runs lightning-fast. Swift UI offers multiple features to add seamless design to your applications. Javascript is called the cockroach of the IT industry. Just like a cockroach, Javascript is expected to never die, if not sooner than later. React Native is a Javascript-based framework which is extensively used for cross-platform mobile app development. It uses the same UI components as native iOS or Android apps. React native apps are functionally similar to other native apps builds independently. It is an open-source framework that has a vast technology-driven community. React Native offer code reusability and helps in building faster and inexpensive applications. Cross-platform development helps save time and coding overheads. Dart is a fast, object-oriented paradigm based, programming language that is used for cross-platform app development. You can use Dart to write simple code snippets and fully-functional applications. Dart has a solution for almost everything under the sun right from desktop app development to web-app, mobile apps, command-line script, and server-side scripting. Dart comes with a flexible compiler technology enabling you to run your code and build as per the target requirement. Dart equips us with a mobile app development framework called Flutter, which we will be discussing later in this article. C#, pronounced as C-'sharp' is another object-oriented language that is extensively used for mobile development. It is majorly used for windows mobile platform. Cross-platform development is another attribute of C# which makes it suitable for mobile development. Technically, C# enables us to do pretty much everything and anything that we can achieve using Swift, JAVA, and Objective-C. Once, you are familiar with C# and you can code in it with ease, you can easily develop mobile apps, desktop apps, games, and web-apps. Thus, considering the dynamism that C# offers, it is going to be one of the top choices for mobile application developers. Coming to Android app development, C++ is considered to be an upstanding choice. What has a firm market hold in the mobile industry are android based systems. Thus, it becomes quite essential to be thorough with C++ to excel in the domain. The syntactical analogy with C# and C is what makes C++ a good option. C++ is majorly used for 3D-Game development. Also, C++ complements Objective-C making it suitable for iOS development as well along with saving development efforts an time. It is widely employed for GUI applications and 3D graphics for games. Properties like exception handling, native development kit and congruity with the Object-oriented paradigm are an add-on which this language offers us.  Those were some good to go mobile development languages which are majorly used for either cross-platform development or Android & iOS development independently. Now, we will be discussing some mobile app development frameworks. Frameworks are the new trend. Learning a programming language can be gruesome for you need to be acquainted with all the ins & outs of it. But learning a programming-language based framework is rather easy. So, let us explore some amazing frameworks that have revolutionized the conventional mobile app development process. Flutter is a cross-platform development framework based on Dart programming language. It was developed by Google. Flutter equips us with tools to build iOS as well as Android apps using a single codebase. Flutter is a great alternative for the numberless Javascript based frameworks that change every day. Also, the applications based on Flutter are almost identical to the native iOS/Android apps in terms of look & feel. Ionic is an open-source framework that is used to build cross-platform mobile app development. According to the official ionic docs, Ionic Framework is an open-source UI toolkit for building performant, high-quality mobile and desktop apps using web technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — with integrations for popular frameworks like Angular and React. Ionic is the perfect choice for hybrid mobile app development. It is an open-source SDK that uses platform-specific UI. Ionic is the only mobile app stack that enables web developers to build apps for all major app stores and the mobile web from a single codebase. Xamarin is a free, open-source, cross-platform mobile app development framework used for building apps with .NET and C#. Xamarin extends the .NET developer platform by facilitating the users to access tools and technologies for iOS, Android and Windows app development. Xamarin provides functionality for directly invoking programs coded in other languages like Objective-C, Java, C, and C++ libraries, enabling you to use a wide range of third party code. Hence, we sum-up the list of top 10 mobile application development programming languages for 2020 which you should consider learning for a promising growth in the software industry as a mobile app developer.
